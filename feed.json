However I&#8217;ve been using WordPress for some years now and I&#8217;m comfortable with it, but the official plugin linking it to Mastodon simply didn&#8217;t work for me. And if I&#8217;ve got this right I can continue with the WordPress blog and have it imported to Micro.blog &#8211; magic! I know it&#8217;s one-way so if I post to Micro.blog it won&#8217;t appear in the WordPress blog, but hey, do I care?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s next?

At least <em>hoping</em> it&#8217;s automatic.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I&#8217;m unlikely to link my domain with Micro.blog within the trial period, even though <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domain-names/53\">it&#8217;s recommended to do it</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;ve chosen to think about this over the weekend, it&#8217;s bordering on an obsession this trying to find out how things work.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've just watched a recording of this week's BBC Question Time, a Thursday evening tv show that assembles a few people who can speak about whatever subjects the audience (both in the studio and having submitted questions beforehand) think are newsworthy. It doesn't matter if they know nothing provided they can speak convincingly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gary Lineker is an ex-English football player who transitioned seamlessly into the profession of sports presenter. He's articulate, witty, and universally liked. Well, pretty-much. He tweets about issues affecting the disadvantaged, i.e. those without a voice, who battle against a political and social system set up to deny them often basic human rights. He tweets about politics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of his latest tweets mentioned the UK Conservative (right wing) government's proposed law to prohibit people claiming asylum if they enter the country using any illegal means, with a policy to then deport them to another country without hearing any asylum claim. Crucially, when they are deported the UK will bar them from ever again applying for asylum.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now of course this ignores the United Kingdom's international legal obligations to treat asylum seekers fairly. And it implicitly defines 'illegal' as whatever the government says it is. And it makes things legal in this country that will be frowned upon by other more tolerant countries, and ignores the people who drew up our once world-class democracy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gary Lineker works for the BBC. His contract is as a freelancer so his political views are irrelevant when it comes to what he says outside work, a fact established as far back as 2016 after one of his Brexit tweets. But neither the assembled Question Time panel nor the chair (who also works for the BBC) mentioned this, or even alluded to it. Instead, speculation and opinion were allowed to muddy the waters. I'm certain the producers of the show would have the facts to hand, but to stifle the question at the outset wouldn't have been as entertaining would it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If he was a political journalist the rules would be different. But he's not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So what did he say when accused of having inflammatory views?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I‚Äôm out of order?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The right wing backlash was immediate, from government ministers to the right-wing press. It actually surprised me how many people from all parts of the political spectrum espouse the concept of free speech for everyone whilst making it plain that Mr Lineker isn't entitled to any.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And so, because the right wing now runs the BBC, the BBC told him that he can not resume his broadcasting duties until the matter is resolved. It \"decided that he will step back from presenting Match of the Day until we've got an agreed and clear position on his use of social media\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was a clear position, a precedent set in 2016 after his Brexit tweets, but the BBC ignored it this week.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And all of his colleagues, and everyone conceivably able to present, when asked to step into his shoes, declined. Because that's the right thing to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "Call this my rationale for becoming a fan of the Cleveland Browns American Football team. Or even my credentials. It's a mangled regurgitation of words I've written since 2015-ish, originally intended to be posted at the start of the 2019 NFL season but left unloved in my Drafts folder until today.\n\n<strong>In the dim and distant past (the 1980s &amp; 90s)</strong>¬†I was a fan of the San Francisco 49ers when they won it all a couple of times (plus the talk of a ‚Äòthreepeat‚Äô). I then aligned with the rebirth and ascendancy of the Jones‚Äô Dallas Cowboys, and then, then‚Ä¶ went off the boil a bit (see below). I still watched the games with friends, went to see the Scottish Claymores in the NFL Europe league, even participated in a peripheral manner in helping out an amateur youth team and helping out with a fanzine.\n\n<strong>A new century dawned and¬†</strong><strong>2004</strong>¬†brought a trip to Ohio, for which I'll add detail another time. An <em>amazing</em> week! It started with the Wauseon Indians High School team (they beat Swanton), following up with Bowling Green (they beat SE Missouri State), and culminating in an extraordinary day in the company of the Browns (who beat the ratbirds (Ravens)!) The icing on the cake: meeting Kevin Mack (who signed a practice ball for me), Dante Lavelli and his wife, and Sam Rutigliano and his wife. Yes, I was very much over-awed (and rendered part-mute by a miserable ear infection.) And a visit to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nI'll admit I wasn't an actual fan of any of the teams we saw over the week, but it didn't matter, it's football!\n\nBack to the jersey. It's a #57, Clay Matthews Jr., by any measure one of Football's all-time Linebacker greats, but likely destined never to reach the Pro Football Hall of Fame (I've visited there too!) He seems to have been in the wrong place (Cleveland) at the wrong time (all sixteen years before he left for the last three of his career); it's got to hurt. As I originally composed this before the 2022 update his name was in the list as a supplemental potential pick after his full eligibility expired. He didn't make it, which bothers me more than it should.\n\nAnd then bang; I got married, we had children, and my hobby time evaporated somehow.\n\n<strong>In 2016</strong>¬†I needed Football in my life again. I chose the San Diego Chargers <em>despite</em> my interest in the Browns purely because San Diego was the city I landed in way back in 1992 on vacation. They just failed to grip my imagination.\n\nMid-April 2019 I found my Browns jersey again. Not just any football jersey, but one bought at beginning of my life as a dad and the end of my life as a regular American Football fan.

I've also looked for podcasts to fall asleep to, thinking I'll be able to subliminally absorb chat and regurgitate on-demand.\n\nYeah‚Ä¶ no.\n\nThe summary, before I overwhelm myself with words: I felt something stirring again.\n\nI swallowed my concern at the cost and, after the week's trial, signed up to the 'Pro'-level of NFL Game Pass. Sure the Browns game was blacked out here in the UK, but I caught all the plays during the 40 minute version the 30 minute lunchtime the day after. It's simply down to me getting old and unable to function like I used to after a game starting after 1am UK time!\n\nThe 2020 and 2021 seasons were eventful and stressful to day the least, everything affected by covid and far more devastating injuries than I remember from any of my previous seasons. But maybe my nerves were on edge throughout, so it seems worse than it was. And it was bad.\n\nAnyway....\n\n<strong>Now, as the 2022 season grows</strong>¬†and controversy follows our team everywhere (more on this another time), looking back to 2018 when this started for me, we Browns fans are currently left with no Jarvis Landry, no Jabrill Peppers and of course no Odell Beckham Junior either, no Rashard (Hollywood) Higgins, no JC Trotter, no Jamie (The Scottish Hammer) Gillan, and most important for me, no Baker Mayfield - our inspirational quarterback.\n\nThis last loss hit me more than most for many many reasons, so much so that I scoured eBay for a suitable jersey to mark the time since I became a Cleveland Browns fan.

An age in which it'd be trivial to debunk lies that no-one would try to fabricate or twist truth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And here we are, twenty-something years into this millennium.

And a wife, invited to Moscow to meet the Russian premier who showed the state's appreciation for her husband's bravery by stating they'd be given funerals of heroes -  ur her husband wasn't yet dead.

One in which an unimaginably large number of nuclear weapons killed an unimaginably larger number of people.  'Threads' it's called.

And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing - not once, ever.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility - for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.</p>\n<p>But with Trump, it‚Äôs a fact. He doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what a joke is - his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.</p>\n<p>Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.</p>\n<p>And scarily, he doesn‚Äôt just talk in crude, witless insults - he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.</p>\n<p>There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It‚Äôs all surface.</p>\n<p>Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.</p>\n<p>Well, we don‚Äôt. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.</p>\n<p>And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath.

				"content_text": "(Originally composed - if that's what one can call this - in June 2019.)\n\nEverything below the line is presented without comment; it's entirely unnecessary:\n\nSomeone [I believe on Quora] asked \"Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?\"\n\n<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Nate-White-44\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nate White</a>, an articulate and witty writer from England, wrote this magnificent response:\n\n\"A few things spring to mind.\n\nTrump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem.\n\nFor instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace - all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.\n\nSo for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump‚Äôs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.\n\nPlus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing - not once, ever.\n\nI don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility - for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.\n\nBut with Trump, it‚Äôs a fact. He doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what a joke is - his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.\n\nTrump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.\n\nAnd scarily, he doesn‚Äôt just talk in crude, witless insults - he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.\n\nThere is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It‚Äôs all surface.\n\nSome Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.\n\nWell, we don‚Äôt. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.\n\nAnd in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.\n\nTrump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.\n\nHe‚Äôs not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.\n\nHe‚Äôs more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.\n\nAnd worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.\n\nThat is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.\n\nThere are unspoken rules to this stuff - the Queensberry rules of basic decency - and he breaks them all. He punches downwards - which a gentleman should, would, could never do - and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless - and he kicks them when they are down.\n\nSo the fact that a significant minority - perhaps a third - of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think 'Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy‚Äô is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:\n\n* Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.\n\n* You don't need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.\n\nThis last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.\n\nAfter all, it‚Äôs impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.\n\nGod knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.\n\nHe makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.\n\nIn fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws - he would make a Trump.\n\nAnd a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish:\n\n'My God‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ have‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ created?\n\nIf being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.\"\n",

				"content_text": "On Wednesday I asked on our primary school‚Äôs school/PTA Facebook page if there was a plan to have video lessons now there‚Äôs no realistic prospect of a return to school before September.\n\nInstead of publicly engaging they replied via a Facebook Messenger message.\n\nTheir focus is now on ensuring levels of staffing so those eligible to physically attend school remain safe, and they‚Äôll email the <em>other</em> parents in the next few weeks to inform us about the transition up to the next year.\n\nIn the next few <em>weeks</em>‚ÄΩ\n\nWe've only a few weeks before term would end anyway.\n\nIncidentally, the only outbound communications with parents since the lockdown began have been via Facebook. The school has a messaging (email, text) service as part of their payments system.\n\nNo, I tell a lie, there <em>was</em> a message sent via the service. It asked all parents to ensure they'd paid their bills for school meals, before and after school clubs‚Ä¶\n\nSo I replied:\n<blockquote>Hiya! I‚Äôve tried to keep [my youngest] to a timetable, motivated enough to do lessons and she‚Äôs been great, not needed too many bribes at all! However, my question started with Zoom/Teams video lessons - actual teacher participation in lessons.\n\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>*Weeks* ago we found that a friend‚Äôs daughter ([3 towns away]) started Zoom lessons the first day of the national lockdown, and today I heard of a school (local-ish, I didn‚Äôt ask) providing 5 Teams lessons *per day.*\n\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It would be fantastic to have someone available for the years not catered for by current plans, it‚Äôs an awfully long time to go without *any* teacher contact.\n\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I‚Äôll be physically back in work in a week and a half; the adjustment to working at the dining room table was hard enough and took way too long for me to balance the needs of family and work. I‚Äôm not a teacher though.\n\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Lots of words, sorry, but I‚Äôd love to hear of more substantial plans; transition‚Äôs going to be too late.\n\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Ta, stay safe.\n\n</blockquote>I‚Äôve heard nothing back since Wednesday. I now know that I left it too late to ask the question; I now know that, at least at this school, years 2, 3, 4 and 5 are now adrift. The head's going to be riding the rest of this school year out and accepting praise from most other parents for the fantastic work she's done.\n\nThey <em>have</em> set lessons on an online educational platform they use, they <em>have</em> directed us to BBC Bitesize web site and the Oak National Academy web site, and to other online resources, of <em>course</em> they have. But meh.\n\nI feel I should say at this point we've had other issues with the way the school has managed my daughter's care in very specific areas but, short of involving the local education authority, we've gone as far as we can internally.\n\nAt this point I really don‚Äôt wish to talk about my oldest daughter‚Äôs high school; as well as only setting lessons and having no video/direct teacher involvement they don‚Äôt even respond to emails sent to the main contact address.\n\nWell, maybe I'll attempt to get things off my chest here when they contact us about an upcoming meeting with her teacher and the form - the opportunity to ask questions.\n\nOh, and be given a lesson on wellbeing.\n\nThree fucking months <em>after</em> the start of lockdown!\n\nThey too will likely be congratulated on the fantastic job they've done.\n\nOne final thing, the only teaching department to give a flying fuck about my oldest daughter completing all the lessons the school has set is Mathematics. Not a single other teaching department has cared enough to offer up 'Conduct' points, not one. Given the ignorant, unsupportive arseholes I had teaching <em>me</em> maths from my first year in junior school right the way through technical college, I have to say my preconceptions have been utterly destroyed. To be fair, I did <em>well</em> in high school CSE maths, but I cannot recall the teacher so I'm throwing them under my bus too.\n\nAnd yes, I've asked the school to comment on the lack of points and teacher participation. That, again to be fair, was Friday. To be unfair I've had no reply to Wednesday's email asking about a specific point mentioned in their latest impenetrably-wordy newsletter. Hey, at least <em>my</em> blog posts have paragraph sizes one can pause for breath between!\n\nOh yes, I've been careful to mention what I see <em>teachers</em> failing at; our related circumstances, though not unique, are private.\n\nAs I said, at this point I really don‚Äôt wish to talk about my oldest daughter‚Äôs high school.\n\nMuch.\n",

(Think of precedent.)\n\nSo what if I'm crap at this 'politics' thing, at least my conscience will be clear for having tried.\n\n<hr>\n\n<em>I'm publishing the post now (3am!) but might come back to flesh it out another time, when I can process what the fuck is happening.</em>\n",

(We finished 6-10 and our Head Coach was just fired after losing the final game to a 1-14 team - of all teams to end a season with it had to be a loss to the Bengals.)</li>\n \t<li>Watching the playoffs. (Cheering for the Bills - our Lake Erie Bros. It's an emotional and a logical choice; emotional because I'll never forget their greatness in 4 consecutive<strong> </strong>Super Bowls<strong> </strong>when I first started watching the sport,<strong> </strong>logical for geographical proximity and an absence of antipathy between our franchises. <s>(I‚Äôm undecided whether to root for the underdog or for teams who‚Äôve beaten us - it‚Äôd only be an attempt to legitimise our losses. Don‚Äôt ask who I‚Äôm thinking of.)</s>\n</li>\n \t<li>Getting more value from NFL GamePass International. (Though the live games were amazing after a long break listening to the radio, a through-the-ages Browns TV marathon might better prep me for 2020.)</li>\n \t<li>Following the inevitable roster cuts. (And hoping Jamie Gillan, 'The Scottish Hammer', makes it; he's earned his place.)</li>\n \t<li>Hoping free agency brings us a dynasty, or at least some successful years. (It‚Äôll only work if we don‚Äôt do the Browns thing and collect wayward personalities and borderline/actual criminals.)</li>\n \t<li>Hoping all who need treatment either return at 100% or have success elsewhere (just not against us!)</li>\n \t<li>Also hoping Myles Garrett's suspension is lifted and he's ready for next season; there's unfinished business - sacks, pressures, dominance, not the <em>other</em> thing.</li>\n \t<li>Speculating on upcoming coaching staff appointments (and how effective they‚Äôre likely to be. Something tells me though that Sam Rutigliano won‚Äôt even apply for the Head Coach job. We absolutely need someone with experience in that role though, someone with proven ability too.)</li>\n \t<li>Wondering what the hell that ‚Äòunique‚Äô organisational thing for the Browns, mentioned before the Bengals game, actually is! (My request in Reddit‚Äôs r/Browns for ways we could go headless wasn‚Äôt at all well received; I‚Äôve speculated that everyone thought I actually <em>wanted</em> it! It would be the most unique thing if it happened, not much else qualifies.)</li>\n \t<li>Living in r/Browns. (And hoping more actually read <em>all</em> the way through my admittedly often silly questions before commenting negatively or downvoting.)</li>\n \t<li>Awaiting the draft (even though I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll find success there, though I know we need O-line I proved to myself I‚Äôm rubbish at guessing who we‚Äôll actually take.)</li>\n \t<li>Reading more Browns history. (I started with Terry Pluto's excellent but depressing/maddening 'False Start: How the New Browns Were Set Up to Fail'.)</li>\n \t<li>I've been reminded there's still room in my life for Britball. (British American football, alongside NFL Europe's Scottish Claymores at one point a bigger part of my life than the NFL. Yeah.)</li>\n \t<li>Wearing what Browns gear I have, often. (I‚Äôm no ambassador, I‚Äôm just this fan, you know?)</li>\n \t<li>Scouring eBay listings for clothes worn by others. (No, it‚Äôs not what you think! Or maybe it is.)</li>\n</ul>\n",

Disregarding the ability of each force to recruit <em>and receive funding to do so</em> at rates compatible with the government's vision, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47225797\">it's actually more than the 22,000 jobs lost due to government funding cuts.</a></em>\n\nHonestly, I'm predicting most nasty party members and supporters, and not forgetting <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gammon_(insult)\">gammons</a></em> will have assumed it'll be bobbies on the streets combating knife crime and Islamic extremism, and in 3 years time will have forgotten about the early pronouncement, <em>despite</em> law and order being their highest priority after leaving the EU.\n\nWhy? Well, they've forgotten about poor people.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanis_Varoufakis\">Yanis Varoufakis</a> </em>recently used a word I prayed I'd never hear in the UK. We've been brainwashed, undergone conditioning to just accept things are as they are. Sure it's been insidious but, in the main, it's worked. It's nothing new of course but the assault <em>has</em> been ramped up in the last few years.\n\nI'd be remiss in not mentioning 1984.\n\nSo, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four\">1984.</a></em>\n\nOr is it Animal Farm?\n\nIt's <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm\">Animal Farm,</a></em> but with real authoritarians.\n\nOr is it a pretty grim future?\n\nPretty grim.\n\nWe need a diversion. Are at war with Iran yet?\n",

It's been <em>years</em> since last that happened, and well before my break for marriage and parenting.</p>\n\n<p>Today, in a game expected to be an easy win for the New Orleans Saints, the Cleveland Browns lost late.  Missed kicks, as during last week's tie, were the key.  Just as last week I listened to it on the 'radio', well actually from within an app on my iPhone.  To add an extra frisson of something akin to desperation, the battery pack decided it wouldn't charge the phone so I was left scrabbling about in desperation for an iPhone charging‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, football.  I've subscribed to the Fark.com news aggregator site for a few years now.  Every gameday someone posts a discussion thread spanning a few games and all and sundry weigh in with opinions, live scores and occasionally brilliantly insane analysis.  It's a bit like I'd imagine an NFL subreddit would be but without the ridiculous and often weaponised downvoting.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this week I decided for the first time to join the fray during the 4th.  Bad mistake.  Bad, bad, bad.  Every, and I do mean every, time I posted the Browns offensive game turned to shiat.  An interception and especially those missed kicks killed us.</p>\n\n<p>'Us'?  Yeah, still feeling a bit of Impostor Syndrome here, but it'll pass.  Perhaps in a few years?</p>\n\n<p>Not telling you what I'm wearing, but it might be different next week.</p>\n\n<p>On a high note, one of at least expectation, the next 5 games should be easier than those first 2.  Or, applying conventional wisdom,  at least one would expect so.</p>\n\n<p>A prediction then.

So yesterday evening I searched here and the Internet at large and the reason became clear.</p>\n\n<p>Finding it, a replica <em>#</em>57 jersey, brought back yet more memories of a road trip at the start of the 2004 season.  Starting with the Wauseon Indians HS team (beat Swanton), following up with Bowling Green (beat SE Missouri State), and culminating in an extraordinary day in the company of the Browns (who beat the Ravens!)</p>\n\n<p>The icing on the cake: meeting Kevin Mack (who signed a practice ball for me), Dante Lavelli and his wife, and Sam Rutigliano and <em>his</em> wife.  Yes, I was very much over-awed (and rendered part-mute by a miserable ear infection.)</p>\n\n<p>I'll admit I wasn't a fan of any of the teams we saw over the week, but it didn't matter, it's football!</p>\n\n<p><em>#</em>57, Clay Matthews Jr., by any measure one of Football's all-time Linebacker greats, but likely destined never to reach the Pro Football Hall of Fame (I've been there too!)  He seems to have been in the wrong place (Cleveland) at the wrong time (all sixteen years before he left for the last three of his career); it's got to hurt.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I'm looking at <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Browns\">Reddit's r/Browns</a> multiple time's a day (even on the toilet, but shhh‚Ä¶), professing nothing but attempting in my singularly-inept fashion to absorb, er‚Ä¶ stuff.  It's an uphill task even attempting to chat with folks bringing the conversation down to my level!  So I tried the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Browns/comments/8apkg3/does_anyone_still_use_browns_irc_its_mentioned_in/\"><em>#</em>browns IRC channel!</a>  It's friendly, quiet (ok, almost unused right now; and that suits me just fine.)  I've <em>also</em> looked for podcasts to fall asleep to, thinking I'll be able to subliminally absorb chat and regurgitate on-demand.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah‚Ä¶ no.</p>\n\n<p>The summary, before I overwhelm myself with words: I can feel something stirring again.</p>\n",

Chastising our lovely female cat is out of the question so last weekend I sliced most of the floorcovering into conveniently-sized rolls and took them to the tip.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile my wife had priced up a very fancy lino to replace the previous luxurious pile. Saturday was fitting day, so Friday after work was me shifting 2 bookcases, 2 CD/DVD shelving units and their contents, an overladen sideboard, and the stuff that builds up as one's loved ones live, all out of the room.</p>\n\n<p>The herringbone-pattern wood block-effect lino is lovely, we won't have the peeing issue again, and most of the furniture and books and stuff is back where it came from. Did it fit right back again without much effort? No; the back of each of the CD shelving units and one bookcase required inexpertly hacking at to accommodate the change in height between the previous and required notches to clear the skirting board.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, of course I've been asked to move one bookcase to replace the living room electric fireplace now donated to charity. No more convenient mug rest for me. (sighs)</p>\n\n<p>I've participated in a small way during the pnut.io Hackathon Weekend. But I'm tired, I've already written too many words, so I'll blog about the wiki next time.</p>\n\n<p>Zzzz‚Ä¶</p>\n",

That's not to say I haven't missed the interactions, I have.  But life, as-ever, got in the way.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not back yet, far from it, but I see encouraging signs.  One of them was an attempt to engage with people I don't know on IRC.  It's literally 20 years since the last time I had a go, and there's no coincidence that was also my first try; it's synchronous chat, quite a fast-paced, and an unforgiving environment.  But once in, it appears a sense of community remains.  Nerds, geeks abound.

				"content_text": "<p>I started to write this post with a point to make and a structure to work around it but part-way through I gave up, the events of last week took away my focus (both in the news and personally.)  So yes, I gave up and just typed stuff.  Here it is:</p>\n\n<p>We all search for meaning in life, whether or not we know it.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy\">Logotherapy</a> provides, when meaning is elusive or nonexistent, an attempt to restore it, to restore an individual's human spirit.</p>\n\n<p>From the Wikipedia article, a basic description:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.<br>\nOur main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.<br>\nWe have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's a branch of psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is, I'll admit, not my forte let alone within my experience.  So, again quoting directly from the article, 'we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways:<br>\n 1. By creating a work or doing a deed;<br>\n 2. By experiencing something or encountering someone; and<br>\n 3. By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering\" and that \"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms ‚Äì to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.\"'</p>\n\n<p>Pretty straightforward stuff it seems: some find meaning in the job they have, others in the sports teams they support, their friends, the pain of loss, or fundraising for those less-fortunate.  Meaning can be found in scenarios from the passive involvement watching a television series, to the total immersion of running a country.  Logotherapy provides a mechanism to make sense of life and to <em>restore</em> an individual's sense of meaning, when all seems otherwise lost.</p>\n\n<p>No, I'm <em>not</em> undergoing any form of externally-sourced therapy, I arrived here during a study of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism\">Totalitarianism</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism\">Authoritarianism</a> and  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism\">Inverted totalitarianism</a> this last being, by the way, the most relevant to our times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In inverted totalitarianism, every natural resource and every living being is commodified and exploited to collapse as the citizenry is lulled and manipulated into surrendering their liberties and their participation in government through excess consumerism and sensationalism.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First coined 14 years ago to describe the tendency of United States governments to increasingly ignore the best interests of <em>all</em> that country's citizens in favour of the few at the top and those who shout the loudest, the description is <em>eerily</em> accurate now.  2016-2017 brought new lows: voter suppression, the rise of the far right, the rise of populism and nativism.  The removal of essential healthcare protections in what was <em>previously</em> easily the world's most expensive healthcare system is particularly disconcerting for those condemned to an uncertain fate by it, and must be utterly terrifying for those condemned to a <em>certain</em> fate.</p>\n\n<p>I'm particularly interested right now in the bit about 'intolerable suffering,' especially my observations of the grades of what people imagine the term 'intolerable' means to them.  We do after all live in times of hyperbole <em>and</em> instant gratification.</p>\n\n<p>I've a list.  It's uncomfortable to write, but I'm in the mood:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Syria and Iraq are currently experiencing unimaginable death tolls, Syria currently engaged in a 6-year-old war.  A site I've linked to elsewhere indicates that 470,000 have been killed in Syria alone since 2011.  That's not just the destruction of essential infrastructure and then the devastation of entire towns and cities, it's the senseless killing of men and women and children and babies.  It's all because human beings don't want to talk to other human beings.</li>\n<li>The USA, is presided over by a man almost universally seen as unfit for government, unable to understand diplomacy, a bully, and even telling the simple truth seems beyond him.  The office he holds was once termed as 'the leader of the free world.'  And yet <em>he</em> needs a legacy.  A US military re-entry into Afghanistan is again on the agenda.  The real possibility of a use of nuclear weapons scares me.  The US's approach to foreign policy fills me with dread.</li>\n<li>Brexit. Yeah, Brexit is, quite simply, a process that should never have been allowed to happen.  Factions within the Conservative Party insisted and the Prime Minister agreed to put the choice to the British people: In or Out of the European Union.  The Liberal Democrats have offered another referendum on the deal the government of the day negotiates with Europe, the choice of approval or disapproval:  The 3 larger political parties reject this, and the British electorate rejected it in the General Election just gone; \"too much politics, we've had enough!\"  How odd; they're rejecting a chance to influence the future of our economy and world standing.  They're throwing away the chance of a future based on <em>real</em> democracy <em>because scratching an 'X' in a box is too hard.</em>\n</li>\n<li>The British Prime Minister is attempting to form a government reliant on the Ulster Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), without <em>any</em> form of agreement between those parties.  Ulster, a province profoundly factionalised on fundamentally religious and nationalistic grounds whilst somehow remaining a part of the United Kingdom, is one in which, for instance, abortion is still illegal.  The DUP, a party with 10 MPs <em>in theory</em> represents an electorate fundamentally opposed to gay <em>and</em> womens' rights, and some seem to believe the world is 6,000 years old.  It's a party retaining links to terrorist organisations loyal to the UK, and a profound divide exists between them and those who wish to rejoin the Irish Republic.  Presumably a side of the divide acceptable to the Conservatives.  Of course loyalty to the UK is somewhat more nuanced now Brexit is imminent.  The DUP, with a total vote share of 292,000 holds the balance of power within a nation of 65 million.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the most uncomfortable fact from the last two elections - in the USA and UK - is that people will vote for things that disadvantage them if they believe the politician has created talking points simply to gain office.  (Of course this is based on both pre-election and exit polls; though an individual's vote is secret and it's unlawful for <em>anyone</em> else to reveal them, a voter can freely state who they voted for.)</li>\n<li>Older voters in particular seemed inclined to vote to reduce protections designed to look after them once unable to care for themselves.  During a pre-Election BBC Question Time broadcast, a third of the panel's questions were put by obviously angry old men intent on destabilising the lives of future generations.  Their universal condemnation of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as a 'terrorist sympathiser', as someone fundamentally opposed to the use of nuclear weapons, as a decent human being and thus presumably unqualified to lead a government, all of it appalled me.</li>\n<li>The very worst of it all is perhaps the most predictable.  It's universally acknowledged that politicians lie, that the businesses lobbying for influence encourage it, that the newspapers and news media organisations shape public opinion to please their financial backers. But ordinary people don't seem to <em>care</em>, and are simply too lazy to check the facts.</li>\n<li>No, I was wrong.  The <em>very</em> worst thing to emerge is the words 'normalisation' or 'normalised.'  We're so accustomed to hearing of hardship elsewhere in the world, so used to hearing of death tolls in far-away places that their significance escapes us until, albeit on a smaller scale, it happens <em>here</em>.  And once it's happened a couple of times and Facebook temporary profile pictures have been pulled down, the root cause is basically ignored.  We remain extraordinarily lucky that the reach of xenophobia and all the other things into our modern societies barely touches <em>our</em> comfortable existences, we simply <em>accept</em> that there'll never be an end to world poverty 32 years after the 'Live Aid' concerts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I could go on, but thinking about things is hard, you see.  I've enough on my plate just reaching the end of each day right now.</p>\n\n<p>There's a saying, purportedly Chinese, which is appropriate on so <em>many</em> levels.  It's this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"May you live in interesting times.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At first it seems a <em>positive</em> phrase, in this context however 'interesting' means unsettled, chaotic, even dangerous.  It's a curse.</p>\n\n<p>We live in interesting times.</p>\n",

The conditions of admission and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the Union is founded, which such admission entails, shall be the subject of an agreement between the Member States and the applicant State.

These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That's it.</p>\n\n<p>Look, this isn't complex.  Anyone who's been to school and can read, anyone who's ever read a novel with more than 27 total characters, can take time to gain understanding.</p>\n\n<p>And this is why I'm scared.  From childhood I've been a voracious reader, though parenthood broke my streak.  Yet I know people who are, if not proud, content to say they've never read a book since leaving school.  Heck though I'm <em>writing</em> a book right now!  Yet they too turned out ok, right?  Apart from that blind faith the same politicians who are screwing them over can guide them to the future prosperity. </p>\n\n<p>I've trotted out this before: if we had the ability to beat the world in making widgets and gadgets and stuff, we'd be doing it already; the European Union has, as far as I know, never stopped us innovating.  Thatcher-era Conservatives did that without any external influences!  But anyway, this road I'm travelling down leads me to all kinds of thoughts, epiphanies.  Here's one.</p>\n\n<p>It's all about imagination.  </p>\n\n<p>Without imagination, the daily paper's articles are statements of fact.  Without an inquiring mind, the politician's repetitive soundbite directed against the common man becomes a thing to be savoured, the mere listening bring a sense of involvement.  Without a thing to contrast against, those 'facts' become facts.  </p>\n\n<p>The imagination I'm thinking of isn't content to believe only a rosy future awaits.  It weighs probabilities, examines history, and extrapolates.  If the result looks bad it doesn't hide under a rock, it attempts to find solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Now I'm a big fan of Star Trek, though even I cannot make the leap to a wholly utopian future United Kingdom, let alone a whole Earth.  I'm not saying the current incarnation of the European Union is a precursor to a future without want, but it's a start.</p>\n\n<p>I fully expect the Conservatives to be confirmed as the righteous guardians of Brexit in a few weeks.  So I'm again voting Liberal Democrat.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I know several people who voted for the first time last June, in the Brexit referendum, their intention being to send a message they‚Äôd had enough. Enough of what I found it difficult to pin down both then and now; not one of them will admit to racist tendencies, well aside from the pensioner my wife encountered outside the polling station: ‚ÄòFinally, a chance to get rid of the darkies,‚Äô she said. My wife said nothing. What a wasted opportunity, on any level.</p>\n<p>A conventional protest vote has a target, and last year‚Äôs was no exception. A conventional election though has an opportunity to change the effects the next time around, by ousting the subsequently-unpopular people who raised the subsequently-unpopular policies. In any event the 2 terms of each government repeats, in general, 2 terms later. But nothing changes apart from the cuts and the discontentment.</p>\n<p>The upcoming General Election provides the best opportunity to change UK politics and thus the direction the country takes for the better, for the long term. Conventional wisdom and the tactical voting spreadsheet doing the rounds online dictate that a Labour vote in all-but secure Liberal Democrat areas is the *only* way to rid ourselves of the troublesome Tories.</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>Voting Liberal Democrat across the board would elect Liberal Democrats who would implement Liberal Democrat policies. It really *is* that simple. Why is this concept so opposite from ingrained, monotonous behaviour?</p>\n<p>The party‚Äôs devastating loss of face after the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition was a predictable consequence of the larger party‚Äôs ability to dictate terms, to insist on, for instance, the humiliating climb-down on increasing student tuition fees. Ask people to name one issue that would preclude voting for each party and this would be the most popular in the casual observers‚Äô response to the LibDems. Given the choice between, for example, raising the minimum tax threshold with the benefit of taking the nation‚Äôs lowest-paid entirely out of tax, or raising those university fees, the choice was plain. I can‚Äôt *begin* to feel the sense of loss most Liberal Democrat politicians must have felt; the inability to explain why the choice had to be made. Appeasement.</p>\n<p>So what do the Liberal Democrats actually represent, whose lives will be made better were they to be elected?</p>\n<p>The easy bit first, making lives better: how‚Äôs about me, how‚Äôs about my family, everyone I know? It‚Äôs a party that aims to not intrude into people‚Äôs lives or business decisions, and to encourage freedom and tolerance. Not in the manner of the Conservatives‚Äô ‚ÄòBig Society‚Äô project (removing funding and support), not by any means.</p>\n<p>The hard differentiating bit, the biggest in-the-news-today bit: Brexit. In common with the other smaller parties not called UKIP they‚Äôre opposed to disturbing the common notion that to derail Brexit would subvert the whole Democratic (big D for definition) process.</p>\n<p>People who voted for Brexit don‚Äôt, in the main, realise that shouting down those who ‚Äòlost‚Äô, calling them ‚Äòlosers‚Äô and demanding they stop moaning is not democracy in action, it‚Äôs paving the way towards a bleak future. It‚Äôs a future in which everyone agrees there‚Äôll be disadvantage for *some* in the UK. As long as it‚Äôs not themselves, but the reality is nobody knows how this‚Äôll all play out.</p>\n<p>This brings me on to an interesting point. Interesting to me, so I‚Äôm writing about it. Someone I‚Äôve know for a long time, who won‚Äôt tell me how they voted last June, has definite ideas on how Brexit will play out. It involves showing our current partners that we can indeed be great again, have lots of things that we can sell that the rest of the non-European world wants, we don‚Äôt need Europe at all, and finally that we should cut our ties *just to see the looks on their faces.* Really, that‚Äôs it. The futility of discussing it at all is evident in 2 areas:</p>\n<p>1. As a ‚Äòloser‚Äô any argument I make is automatically diminished, even dismissed, simply because I lost. Unless we‚Äôre discussing Turkey‚Äôs 51%/49% vote margin, to turn their premier into a de-facto dictator for maybe the next 12 years. *That‚Äôs* not democracy is it!</p>\n<p>2. Any point I raise in response to a politician‚Äôs obvious lie or inability to effectively communicate is deemed ‚Äújust your opinion.‚Äù Yeah.</p>\n<p>I can imagine what it‚Äôll be like when the to-be-elected politicians decide to impose more cuts, real austerity measures; the inevitable tax rises and service cuts won‚Äôt be popular. But I‚Äôm rambling again‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>The Liberal Democrats are, to me, the obvious choice. Everyone who votes Liberal Democrat is making a choice to move away from the bit of the status quo we have direct control over: a move away from the Conservative Party, a move away from the once Conservative-lite now ostensibly Marxist-lite but still Parliamentary Conservative-lite Labour Party.</p>\n<p>So go on then, why, specifically the LibDems?</p>\n<p>I read the document linked to in <a href=\"https://bt3.com/2016/07/05/words/\">one of my previous blog posts</a>, the document itself is the Preamble to the Liberal Democrat Constitution. My blog post, though *almost* inconsequential, at least provides some sense of my interest. The document is not, you will note, a Manifesto. I‚Äôm not linking to that. Why? Rhetorical question: When was the last time all of a Manifesto‚Äôs promises were implemented?</p>\n<p>How long have we got to restore sanity to the UK? 6/7 weeks.</p>\n",

It's very unlikely there's anyone else alive born in the 1800s, the nineteenth century, the end of the Victorian era.

No, mine is a sense of missing something.</p>\n\n<p>There's a scene in one of the Lord of the Rings movies which brought to life something I'd never really considered in depth.  The specific scene, though powerful, is unimportant here; what is is something seen in old, grand churches: statues side-by-side above stone tombs, once lovers, creators of life, holders of shared dreams, together forever in stone, mourned by fewer and fewer and then none as the passage of time takes those who once <em>knew‚Ä¶</em></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, sure it's a privileged few afforded such a luxury in death.  The common man gets nothing likely to last even tens of years.  The despots, the landowners, the moneyed classes of our history: immortalised.</p>\n\n<p>Will the Trump era be looked back on with anything approaching warmth, a sense of a shared timespan, a belief of having achieved something?</p>\n\n<p>Can I place a bet?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/texrat/status/823630847794356225\">a bragging-rights-only wager with @texrat (Twitter), that the White House Press Secretary will last only until late August 2017.</a>  Randall thought he'd be gone roughly by the end of March.

				"content_text": "<p>I subscribed to the online editions of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com\">The Washington Post.</a>  Yes it's a US news company!  At USD$19 for an entire year it was an easy decision.  I live in the UK but haven't yet done the same for any other UK news organisation, apart from giving a few pounds to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk\">The Guardian</a> (paywall-free.)  Incidentally, both 'newspapers' are running very similar headlines today, very encouraging.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, sure I pay an annual Licence Fee to the BBC and read their news, watch their telly, but the reporting is often infuriatingly bland and airs weeks past the time I've already seen it elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>Where was I?  Yes, one of the reasons I subscribed to the Washington Post was reporter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fahrenthold\">David Fahrenthold's</a> tenacious examination of Donald Trump's assertions that the President-to-be gave away millions to charity.  What is certain is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/david-fahrenthold-tells-the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-his-year-covering-trump/2016/12/27/299047c4-b510-11e6-b8df-600bd9d38a02_story.html\">the majority of charitable donations were falsely recorded</a> and that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/washington-posts-david-fahrenthold-wins-pulitzer-prize-for-dogged-reporting-of-trumps-philanthropy/2017/04/10/dd535d2e-1dfb-11e7-be2a-3a1fb24d4671_story.html\">the work won Mr Fahrenthold a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.</a>  And the reporting of his humanity, non-superhero ordinariness, in connection with that glitter gun.</p>\n\n<p>I'm conscious of drawing from perhaps a greater breadth of sources than most other people when formulating my position on often complex ideas.  And often simple ideas.  Last year I asked around and gratefully received suggestions for people and media companies from which I could draw a wide range of opinions.  With hindsight I bit off more than I could comfortably chew and had to step away from the process.</p>\n\n<p>I can't say I'm much wiser now but the perspectives I've gained have led me to a more balanced approach than you'd know by reading some of last year's blog posts, e.g. <a href=\"http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2016/06/25/regrexit\">'Regrexit'</a> and <a href=\"http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2016/06/26/chainsaws\">'Chainsaws'.</a></p>\n\n<p>In public at least.</p>\n\n<p>The Washington Post subscription includes (from the welcome email):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited access to washingtonpost.com from any device.</li>\n<li>Unlimited access to our entire suite of mobile apps for iOS, Android and Fire Tablet.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><em>The Optimist</em></strong>, a weekly email newsletter highlighting positive stories.</li>\n<li>Post Most, a weekday email newsletter with a rundown of popular stories.</li>\n<li>Shared digital access for an additional user.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(My emphasis above.)</p>\n\n<p>Do they have any <em>idea</em> how inappropriate 'Optimist' will be for me‚ÄΩ</p>\n\n<p>Joking aside I remember Martyn Lewis, a national UK news anchor saying he wanted to insert one 'feel-good' story into every bulletin.  His rationale being that there's too much depressing news.  At the time I agreed; now though it's entirely the wrong message to send to ordinary people.  Given the magnitude of the worldwide change we're living through, I believe it's important to focus on the bad stuff.</p>\n\n<p>There's one big problem with my current reasoning: if you make reporting so detailed that people don't want to watch they'll go to where the grass is greener, airbrushed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing\">astroturfed‚Ä¶</a>  Yeah.  Fairness, balance.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, here's a link to a web page with a photo of a squirrel with big nuts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fark.com/farq/about/\">http://www.fark.com/farq/about/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt as to my motives here at the end, <a href=\"https://fark.com\">Fark.com</a> is my all-time favourite news-related site; the comment pages there are awesome.  Awesome in a mainly US-centric, rounded but occasionally very unbalanced, good way.  I pay them to remove ads.</p>\n",

It got me thinking again of what minimal set of events would precipitate a decline into times in which our society could condone such events.  You've had only to look casually at the TV in recent years to find programmes about 'Doomsday Preppers', disease-created zombies or worse, the shutdown of the electricity grid, aliens intent on extracting all our planet's resources before moving on to the next mining proposition‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Go on then, what, practically, could sow the seeds of our society's destruction?</p>\n\n<p>Our reliance on complex but easily-interrupted food distribution chains, the effect of social media on the ability of looters to congregate on and to lay waste to city centres, the notion that terrorists could strike anywhere even with the complete absence of coherent attack strategies, the transmission of disease across international and across species boundaries, the emboldening of xenophobes as government administrations move towards embracing nativism-inspired lawmaking?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, fragile.  So what can we <em>do</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing, apart from conform to normal societal rules and hope that like the winds of change, it'll all blow over us without <em>too</em> much damage.  And that's the problem, as vested interest has the rules change, the moral compass becomes destabilised.  Has anyone from any other previous era, outside of wartime, had the rules change literally overnight?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n\n<p>I've read (and watched 2 versions of) Orwell's 1984, read and listened to Orwell's Animal Farm, experienced the dread of imagining the speed of onset of a technological catastrophe during The Terminator series, read Asimov's Foundation series and felt a hope inspired by knowledge there may just be a shadowy organisation skilled in manipulating populations and <em>then</em> crushed as one man with abnormal skills brings it all crashing down‚Ä¶  Then there's the similarities between 28 Days Later, The Walking Dead, and Shaun of the Dead; the gulf between the dystopian Star Wars and the utopian Star Trek; the time between the first screening of 'Metropolis' through The Twilight Zone's 'To Serve Man', to the present day's fascination with superhero movies.  I'd best not mention 'The Matrix'.  Do you remember Bird Flu, note that colds and flu last <em>forever</em> these days, and at any one time, someone you know could easily be carrying an antibiotic-resistant strain of some superbug that'll mean a few days off work, or death (whichever is the least benign?)  And finally, during a recent bout of flooding in the northwest of England the entire nation's production of pink sandwich and custard cream biscuits stopped.  Ok, really finally: when a major UK retailer decided the post-Brexit-announcement price rises after the consequent fall in the value of the GB Pound could not be passed directly on to the customer so the supplier's profit margin must take the hit; thus iconic products temporarily disappeared from shelves as people panic-bought - no Marmite!</p>\n\n<p>Having an active imagination at a time like this isn't helpful.</p>\n",

No mobiles, no photography.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>School sports days, Christmas plays:</strong> Advance notice of no photography, yet parents insisting it's their right to do so are sneaky about it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The cinema:</strong> Yeah, looking at your full-brightness phone and taking selfies are simply antisocial; recording the movie would get you thrown out (though likely not prosecuted) if <a href=\"http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2017/02/05/cinema\">the grumpy old bastard behind</a> is feeling vindictive.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Drivers:</strong> Is it too difficult to wait until you can find a safe place to stop before answering or making that call.  It's been illegal to phone on the move for a while now, along with drinking anything, adjusting your stereo, and even picking your nose you dirty scrotum!  Heck, being in the phone driving down the residential streets where you live and your children play is idiotic.  Getting in your car after picking up your kids from school surely getting home <em>safely</em> is your highest priority.  After driving at my wife and children.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Walking along the street, crossing the road:</strong> This <em>should</em> be obvious.  Cars are hard, very hard indeed.  Bouncing off mine might sting for a while, and though my elbow is less-likely to inflict permanent damage as I protect myself, my tongue is likely to be sharper than you realise.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It's lawful to take public photos of my daughters:</strong> I won't like it much, especially if it looks as-if you're doing it covertly.  But I know it's your right to do so.  Making you feel uncomfortable by staring at you until you leave is <em>my</em> right.  One day I might even snap you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Er‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>I think it's time to have a go at composing part 6 of my Maker's Mark whiskey review series.

				"content_text": "<p>I bowed to popular demand* and wrote what follows about the third Bourbon Whiskey I've ever tried.  Well, the fourth bottle of the stuff.  My first experience was 2 consecutive bottles of Buffalo Trace, then one of Wild Turkey 101 and, as the subject line indicates, I'm now trialling Maker's Mark.</p>\n\n<p>Ahhh, what a day <em>that</em> was‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>No, no!  It takes over a week per bottle, honestly!  Jeez!</p>\n\n<p>First though, my earlier post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Drunk with a single ice cube with me at room temperature: oh.<br>\nSmells amazing.<br>\nTo be continued‚Ä¶\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the guy who recommended it, the comment that precipitated this, an unprecedented same-day update:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Enough about the smell. Do you like the taste? That was my favourite favourite.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>No.  Not yet.</p>\n\n<p>It's rather nice to start with but there's an aftertaste which comes on quickly that I'll admit I'm not liking.  It spans my first neat test, and today's single ice cube (just-melted.) Buffalo Trace seems to have a cleaner finish; Wild Turkey 101, though a bit too strongly alcoholic at 50.5% for me, seems to lack this unpleasant fall-off too.  All pull back my gums and attack my lips to a greater or lesser extent, which is rather nice, <em>if</em> I let them.</p>\n\n<p>No, I haven't a bloody clue what I'm talking about, especially if I'm using anything like understandable terminology, but I know what I like.  Bear in mind that I've been drinking Scotch whisky for over 20 years, off-and-on, culminating in the utterly awesome Laphroaig 15-year-old, a whisky now withdrawn from general sale and thus prohibitively expensive.  Incidentally, the 10 year old is a good substitute but don't make the mistake I did of trying the 'Select', it's completely unrepresentative of the fine brand.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, the hardest bit about this experience so far is not admitting that I'm not too keen on the whiskey someone I trust recommended, nor is it the effort in typing right now not long after reaching the bottom of the second glass.  No, it's getting through the melted plastic covering the Maker's Mark bottle cap.  The pull-tab is utterly unsuitable for its intended purpose, so much so that I almost had to get the Swiss Army Knife out!  It <em>looks</em> nice but I get the impression it took quite some time to design it to make it look as though it's an organic continuation of a product of a bygone age.  Heck, it might be but I'm not sufficiently invested in it to find out.</p>\n\n<p>However‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>To be continued‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Yes, you.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>There'll be a better way of summing up what follows than the title I chose, but it'll do.  I'm referring to the monologue Andrew Neil delivered a couple of nights ago, a bunch of words strung together to invoke national pride on our past, and which was subsequently described as, well, read the article here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/783357/Andrew-Neil-London-Westminster-attack-monologue-BBC-terror-Churchillian\">\"'Churchillian!' Viewers hail Andrew Neil's INCREDIBLE monologue on Westminster attack\".</a> <em>(from The Daily Express newspaper, 2017-03-24.)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>I happen to like Andrew Neil.  His no-nonsense approach to interviewing sits well with me.  His sarcasm, always it seems tinged with an impish glee upon finding a politician wanting, fits my needs far better than the always-annoyed Jeremy Paxman ever did, he doesn't needlessly interrupt his guests as they're answering his questions as does Andrew Marr.  But his monologues irritate me.  They always go on a bit too long, and always keep me from why I watch his late-night programme: to learn what's going on in the world of politics.</p>\n\n<p>Before I continue, I haven't watched this edition of his show, I'm relying on the Daily Telegraph's editors to show me a full picture of what transpired on the night.  Yeah‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>The key phrases from Mr Neil are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Do you have any idea who you‚Äôre dealing with?  This is the country that stood up alone to the might of the Luftwaffe, air force of the greatest evil mankind has ever known.  If you think we‚Äôre going to be cowed by some pathetic, Poundland terrorist in an estate car with a knife, then you‚Äôre as delusional as you are malevolent.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fine words that would have made sense in an era vastly-different from the one in which we live, an era in which it was easy to spot the source of terror, the evil across a tiny stretch of water known as the English Channel.</p>\n\n<p>Fine words which conveniently ignore the fact that this isn't the 1940's.</p>\n\n<p>During those times, and in general terms only, the only loose parallel I can make is that of an entire nation aspiring to impose its ideologies upon the rest of the world.  That as-opposed to taking over other nations by armed might and controlling them by repressive regimes; something the British would conveniently ignore.  When their politics failed to spread much beyond the German border, war became inevitable, at which point other alliances were built, sides taken.</p>\n\n<p>It was a war propelled by the industrial might of nations, their armed forces' skills honed by regional conflicts outside, initially at least, Germany's borders.  It was a war of technological superiority, of a rapid development of new instruments of war applied effectively against adversaries who didn't expect another conflict, especially with the smug, humiliating victory of The War To End All Wars.</p>\n\n<p>And then there's the media.  During the Second World War the British were lucky to read or hear about major events within <em>days</em>, even if the British government deemed it <em>acceptable</em> that ordinary citizens knew what was going on. The newspapers were censored; the radio was mostly censored, save for the enemy's propaganda broadcasts; the newsreels shown in cinemas showed only <em>British</em> propaganda.  No satellite-fed coverage, no 24 hour telly, no social media gossip-spreading, no instant messaging.</p>\n\n<p>People all over the world listened to what Mr Churchill said, and <em>believed</em> it.  They listened to what Mr Hitler said and <em>believed</em> it.  There was nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>'Intelligence' is a word often derided nowadays when a terror attack happens.  The futility of the security services monitoring <em>everything</em> for that 'just in case' scenario was shown up nicely by the events of mid-last week; a man simply not monitored for links to terror plunges a nation into crisis.</p>\n\n<p>But how was it during WWII?  Well, the British successfully created fake airfields filled with fake aircraft, and the high-level (or fast low-level) reconnaissance flights provided compelling evidence that the enemy strategists were fooled.  Fields of fake tanks and other fake armoured vehicles at other times had the same effect.  Surveillance technology was simply ineffective against what might now be termed laughable subterfuge.  Maps were often hopelessly out-of-date; even the things we take for granted now: accurate digital mapping, aerial and pseudo-3D street-level walkthroughs were the stuff of next-millennial science fiction.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays it's well established that the industrial might of a nation can be trivially assessed by picking up a phone and Googling for statistics.  Seventy years ago it was guesswork, all of it.  If the enemy had known how close Britain's Air Force was to running out of aeroplanes and the means of manufacturing more, this world may have been a vastly different place.  Intelligence failed.  Perhaps it'd be kinder to say the British resolve triumphed, because that's what we <em>want</em> to believe.</p>\n\n<p>In short what we're facing now is utterly unlike anything we've experienced previously.</p>\n\n<p>I say 'we' conveniently ignoring the millions in the Middle East who must deal with this kind of hell on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>It's not the threat of a nation clad impeccably and riding iron steeds, no.  It's the threat of the ordinary man or woman or child radicalised by the unending and implacable hatred of those who simply don't care about anyone but those with whom with imagined special relationships are key.  It's the threat that each and every one of <em>them</em> needs only a knife and a car to commit unspeakable acts.  It's the knowledge that <em>anyone</em> can kill or maim or destroy using the most basic of tools, the knowledge that just because someone looks different or <em>doesn't</em> look different they can achieve the same ends.</p>\n\n<p>I intended to close with the sarcastic 'Aren't we lucky to live now?', intending to show that ignorance was indeed bliss 70 years ago.  Not knowing how perpetually close to defeat Britain <em>was</em> helped morale immensely.  Not knowing that the rationing of basic foodstuffs and household essentials would last far beyond the end of the war, it helped too.</p>\n\n<p>I'll instead close with <a href=\"http://bazbt3.github.io/2016/07/15/Nice/\">this blog post from 2016, 'Nice'</a> which refers to my near-identical post from 2015.  If I'd started blogging earlier there'd be others pointing out the folly of allowing ignorance to fester, of allowing jingoistic nationalism to grow unchallenged.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As is usual I've not proof-read this knee-jerk reaction.</p>\n",

The founder has delayed the first stage reward for the backers, pushing back the assignment of usernames until the roll-out of the first stage of the networking bits</p>\n\n<p>Why <em>didn't</em> I back it?  Simple really, the concept started off as a request for funds to assist in writing a <em>book</em>.  Whether supplied by paper or electronic delivery I'm not certain, but it's a bit of an anachronism in this electronic age.  No bother, the blogging/social aspect is intriguing, especially the desire to appoint a manager to stamp on trolls and antisocial behaviour.

I <em>said</em> I'd think about it, so did.</p>\n\n<p>Constipation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"irregular and infrequent or difficult evacuation of the bowels; can be a symptom of intestinal obstruction or diverticulitis\"  <em>(Definition from iOS Terminology app.)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Humans have evolved to consume various edible items (and, for pleasure, some plainly inedible or noxious), to process them and convert  into nutrients, and finally to expel the resultant waste.  Ok, not just humans, pretty-much everything alive on the planet operates in a similar fashion.  What differs between us at the top, and those below us on the food chain, is our insatiable desire to consume, process, and to, er‚Ä¶ <em>talk</em> about stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, a bit short of suitable metaphors here; 'constipation' isn't a bad pinnacle, right?</p>\n\n<p>But there's only so far that balancing act between consumption and dissemination can take the average sane person.  <em>I</em> gave up where someone with more confidence, more psychopathic tendencies would, has and will, advance further.  I saw the effect on myself of the constant osmosis of facts and figures, and simply didn't like where it would take me.</p>\n\n<p>That's not to say I removed myself entirely from the stimuli, that's impossible.  Avoiding Brexit and Trump though, it's tantamount to <em>acceptance</em>, and I simply cannot roll over and submit to the propaganda machines rolling over pretty-much everything I've assumed would provide <em>stability</em> for me, my wife and, the reason large numbers of folks believe we're on this planet in the first place: my 2 lovely daughters.</p>\n\n<p>Though we're not in the midst of an actual <em>wartime</em>, it'd be fair to say we live in times of unprecedented upheaval.

				"content_text": "<p>I recently came across a retweet mentioning a news article about a Mossley (NW England) discordant neo post-punk band named Cabbage.  The ironies within the article, well, I've already determined 2017 will be one led and thus eventually  characterised by Schadenfreude.  Now the band's genre isn't my usual cup of tea, but the introduction alone was definitely something helping to drag me out from the depths of my post-New-Year funk.</p>\n\n<p>Here's why‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>The publicity wasn't because of their music, at least not directly.  No, it was their frank, <em>gloriously frank</em>, response to the British national tabloid newspaper* attempting to champion them as one of their sounds of 2017.  To see what I suspect is merely the iceberg-tip of the band's response, here's a <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/cabbage-manchester-sun-newspaper-twitter-12394379\">Manchester Evening News article</a> -  sanitised only by redacting the entirely-appropriate sweary language.</p>\n\n<p>I asked the band on Twitter for their recommendation; which of their albums should I buy?  The response was, in hindsight, entirely predictable.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>@ahcabbage: @bazbt3 @antmeals anything by @TheBlindersBand</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I simply ignored their response, hoping for something more, a 'Best Of'.  Heh, Baz playing the long game‚ÄΩ</p>\n\n<p>A few days later they released a compilation album, 'Young Dumb And Full Of‚Ä¶'!  Yes, the ellipsis <em>is</em> a part of the album title; and though the dystopian days of 'Bollocks' aren't over yet, not for me at least, there's enough of an <em>implication</em> there to satisfy this listener.</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe it's a shorter word, one that rhymes with, er‚Ä¶  Yeah, I think I'll step away from <em>that</em> one!  </p>\n\n<p>I bought and listened to the album all the way through, turned up loud enough to enjoy it as I'm imagining the band intended (and then turned down a bit for this old man's ears.)  I was struck first by how the passage of time hasn't dulled my inability to discern the actual lyrics of a song; but it's not a criticism, there's enough there to keep me interested.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>second</em> thing that struck me relates to some of the melodies; I'm sure there's some Talking Heads (I'm a fan) and a bit of Kosheen too.  Perhaps if I listen some more I'll <em>find</em> more, but is that perhaps missing the point?  Naah, is it bollocks: Music is Music!</p>\n\n<p>Suffice it to say that, whilst I'm drawn to the obvious parallels with the Sex Pistols (yes, I'm <em>that</em> old but wasn't a fan at the time) this isn't a rehash, doesn't seen like an homage.  It's shiny and new.  Ok not shiny, it's spiky stuff this.</p>\n\n<p>I'm emphatically no music reviewer, but I do know what I like.  'Young Dumb And Full Of‚Ä¶' by Cabbage thus gains Baz's seal of approval, is rated 10/10 for the timely (and in some respects timeless) music <em>and</em> for dragging me out of my 1977-to-early-nineties musical comfort zone.</p>\n\n<p>Ta Cabbage.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Why yes, it <em>is</em> in fact the hated Sun misjudging our cultural history.</p>\n",

Not at all to do with money, budgets, etc.  No.</p>\n\n<p>Yes.</p>\n\n<p>I attended and had my lifestyle (sniggers, wishing I could afford one) dissected, my height and weight and blood pressure checked, and a sample of blood taken.  As I left I was informed that if the blood sample yielded nothing untoward I could look forward to a reminder to visit again in five years.</p>\n\n<p>Today I received a letter asking me to ring the surgery as there's a 'routine message on their screen'.  That's it.  Now I'm guessing my cholesterol is a bit high, as it was the last time it was checked, and high in common with most with my activity levels and dietary intake.  But why not tell me in the letter, instead of wasting my time again?</p>\n\n<p>Sure I'm being ungrateful for the chance to improve my quality of life, or maybe increase the life expectancy itself.  It just seems such a waste having me ring and speak to someone, i.e. not a doctor, but someone who I don't really want to know anything about my health.  It's private matter between me and a doctor, right?</p>\n\n<p>And anyone who reads this.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, one good thing to come out of this, the bathroom scales are indeed accurate, damnit; and I've lost a little weight in the months prior to #Movember 2016 - in which I'm not participating, at least not in the, blokish, laddish, growing face fuzz manner.</p>\n\n<p>No, I'm starting in earnest the process of looking after myself.</p>\n\n<p>Just like last year.

Now if you say <strong>alt-Christians</strong> I'd accuse you of jumping on a bandwagon, but it'd be a start.</p>\n\n<p>alt-, disregarding the computer keyboard usage, used to refer to an alternative, was never used to mask true meaning and thus legitimise an unacceptable stance.  Now, the alt-Right, far from being an alternative to it, is about as far right politically as it can be.</p>\n\n<p>Neo- is the same.  At their core  the redefinitions are intended to hide‚Ä¶  OK, when all is said and done it matters not <em>what</em> prefix is used; a Fascist is a Fascist, a Nazis a Nazi, a racist a racist, and a Cheeto-faced short-fingered vulgarian shitgibbon is, well‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Language usually evolves slowly; nuanced changes are the norm, but adoption of slang, buzzwords is driven considerably faster by technological development, wars.</p>\n\n<p><em>Politics</em> though?</p>\n\n<p>‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Oh, <em>that</em> precedent!</p>\n\n<p>We must look back only to the first third of the twentieth century, a time within living memory, to find widespread adoption of new social norms of the type that negatively impacted large swathes of the world's population.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the rise of National Socialism, the Nazis.  <em>They</em> had a movement too!  It too stirred up the population against those it deemed subhuman.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm not about to compare and/or contrast the Nazis with the grossly perverted and repressive practises enacted in the name of Communism.  Suffice it to say the acts of subjugation, abductions, torture, deaths, all, <em>all of them</em> were carried out perfectly legally too.  Laws made by executive decree and which wiped out any semblance of regard to the human dimension when lawmaking.  Laws enacted in single countries without regard to the impact on their own citizens and the world at large.  All enacted in the guise of making (country) great again.</p>\n\n<p>The 1930s brought a number of organisations out in support of the Nazis.  OK, maybe that's unfair, at least to the one I'm picking on to flesh this out: the 'America First Committee' .  Setup after the start of World War 2 their core beliefs centred around building defences to keep the world from inflicting the war upon America.  In simple analysis a noble ideal: look after your own first.  The world had changed irrevocably since.</p>\n\n<p>What hasn't though, simple ignorance.  If I was being charitable I'd say it was a desire to hold on to traditional values.  But I'm <em>not</em> being charitable.</p>\n\n<p>I read a series of tweets earlier today from an American, an ex-military man, an egg injured in the line of duty whilst stationed in Iraq.  Gross in their extreme as the tweets were, he seemed to truly believe his Christianity, his military service and <em>especially</em> his injury, all qualified him to ignore the humanity of those born in other countries.  He detailed precisely how and where he'd kill them, which munitions he'd use.  His statements on the Koran's commandment to kill everyone not of the faith were genuinely held.  But 'genuine' cannot be conflated with well-informed.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, he believed his government would look after him <em>personally</em>, owed him a debt of gratitude.  Now I read only his side of the many conversations, and came to two conclusions.  He was either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Trolling or</li>\n<li>Genuine.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the latter case its probably appropriate to consider the impact of his protest vote personally.  He may need healthcare, may as an ex-serviceman rely on a small income, may be reliant on food stamps‚Ä¶  But the bit that I cannot help thinking of, the simple fact that he was wounded.  His president is on record as stating his utter absence of respect for someone who allowed themselves to be captured and faced years of brutal torture whilst on duty.  So to think oneself special after carelessly allowing the enemy to draw blood?  No, sorry, not worthy.  Here we go, back again to Schadenfreude.</p>\n\n<p>Back for a moment to the notion that Muslims must kill all nonbelievers:  Within the Bible, and the Torah the book of Deuteronomy is easy to find, which implies <em>wilful</em> ignorance on the part of pretty much everyone who calls the entire Muslim world terroristic.</p>\n\n<p>They have my scorn, the time for acceptance in the name of expediency is over.  That's not to say I will not take the time to understand different viewpoints, far from it.  But some causes are hopeless.</p>\n\n<p>Ignorance, it's the cornerstone of whatever the hell is happening in this world right now.  A desire to ignore the realities of injustice, of social and economic change, a desire to return to the past, a past in which life was fundamentally simpler.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, it's time we chose a different word for those who call themselves Christians but hold none of the core beliefs.  A term that encompasses their fire-and-brimstone approach to those worshipping at different altars, their ignoring of the broken stranger in the road, the repulsion towards the refugee fleeing crises unimaginable even in times of previous conflict.  It's time those holding <em>pre-</em>Christian beliefs were given personal responsibility for, shown the consequences of, their actions.</p>\n\n<p>No, I really do <em>not</em> know what term I'd apply.  I'm a simple man, see.  It says so in my bio.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Disclosure</em>: You should know that, whilst I call myself an atheist, I'm not singling out Christianity here, simply hypocrisy.  I visit the local church a few times a year with my girls and often feel slightly awkward that these people welcome me without an inquisition.  That said I hold many Christian <em>values</em> because it seems <em>right</em> to do so.  And, I must say, I have a yearning to know more about the tenets, the core, of basic Buddhism.</p>\n",

They're a cheap attempt to express my solidarity both with those less fortunate than I and those who feel their opportunities to change things are limited.</p>\n\n<p>I chose retweets not quotes, as quotes occasionally bring the kind of attention I used to find unwelcome.

A popular vote couldn't even persuade the British establishment name a <em>ship</em> according to the majority, and yet‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Attempts by powerful people to erode democracy are <em>working</em> everywhere I look outside the comfort of my chosen circle.  It's why I've scaled back use of Twitter already, and I've never really got back into Facebook‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>To those who would say we must accept it, that protest is futile, or that a march <em>for</em> women or <em>for</em> minorities is essentially <em>against</em> white men: <strong>no, we must</strong> <strong><em>not!</em></strong>  There is better to be had from those we elect; just rolling over and accepting <em>this</em> as being the best there is, is just wrong.</p>\n\n<p>We are living in a time during which the norms of modern society, worked for by those who would protect humanity as a whole rather than a narrow strip running through it, will be wiped out by the stroke of a pen, both here in the UK and, more quickly, in the 'United' States of America.</p>\n\n<p>Of course it's easy for me to <em>say</em> all this, safely nestled in my comfy chair.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Wikipedia and fact-checking organisations like snopes.com are your friend.</p>\n",

I know I'm not the first to write about this but I'm on a bit of a journey right now.\n\nYou'll probably have visited web sites integrating a chat thing into their pages. Often it's an intrusive popup asking cheerfully if you'd like help with something <em>anything</em>.

It seemed to be a copy and paste session, the likes of which is these days run by 'bots.

				"content_text": "<p>During the springtime of 2013 I decided to join a new online community at <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/App.net\">App.net</a>  <em>(Wikipedia entry)</em>.  Heck, as it'd recently changed to a' Freemium' funding model I even <em>paid</em> for social networking!  Today (Friday the thirteenth in year 1 PostCelebPocalypse) I found that the service will close in the middle of March 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Its major strengths: no ads, 256 character posts, <em>awesome</em> apps, and a willingness by all to engage with and welcome newcomers.  It simply wasn't too <em>big</em>.  Though on the surface an oasis of calm amidst the chaos of the wider Internet there were indeed flaws, the business model wasn't perfect, but it didn't matter to me, I 'belonged'.</p>\n\n<p>The apps that stood out for me in a network originally setup to encourage and to fund app and service development:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Felix by @billkunz (I bought a t-shirt),</li>\n<li>Riposte and Whisper by @jaredsinclair &amp; @jaminguy (I bought the t-shirt),</li>\n<li>Chimp by @ludolphus (<em>is</em> there a shirt‚ÄΩ),</li>\n<li>Kirby by @griff (no shirt).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So Baz haz a sad that the inevitable end is near.  But why, seeing as I've not been an active participant since before the middle of 2016?</p>\n\n<p>Signing up to App.net (ADN) resulted in the some of the best things, the most stimulating things (even including btinternet.chatter!) I've ever done online.  Rather than simply participate I joined in.</p>\n\n<p>My big but short, exhaustive but necessarily incomplete, list of stuff:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As-of right now I've posted way more than 28,260 things there, including reposts.  That alone should tell you something.</li>\n<li>I badly ran #ThemeMonday for a while after @berklee bowed out.  Though it doesn't sound much we changed our avatars every month, created individually to a theme chosen by popular vote.  It was fun!</li>\n<li>I took over #QuoteSunday from @zephyr.  (We posted quotations from famous, infamous, and not-so-famous people; all to suit our mood on the day.)</li>\n<li>I created a rudimentary Linux shell script to interact with App.net on the command line.  Baz the programmer!  (I called it <a href=\"https://github.com/bazbt3/ayadn_shell\">ayadn_shell</a> partly in homage to @ericd's awesome Ayadn rubygem but mainly because, without that application onto which mine piggybacked, mine simply would not work let alone be possible!)</li>\n<li>After a happening by chance onto a conversation started by someone tired of being tired I collaborated on an MMTPORPAG (minutely-massive-two-player-online-role-playing-adventure-game.)  An <a href=\"https://posts.app.net/64581696\">Adventure</a> of epic proportions; at least it would have been if my life hadn't got in the way.  <em>Thanks</em> @mlv.  (Incidentally, I can't get the specific <a href=\"http://treeview.us/home/thread/64581696#a64581696\">Treeview.us</a> thread to load, I'd love to archive the whole thread.  <strong><em>Help please!</em></strong>)</li>\n<li>I became a Wiki Editor for a while at the now defunct App.net Wiki, a volunteer-run repository for the minutiae of a social network.  I <a href=\"http://bt3.com/index.php?title=Testing\">tested new ideas</a> at my personal site.  Thanks @kdfrawg, for letting me fiddle for a while.</li>\n<li>I took over #WednesdayChallenge (#WedC) from @nitinkhanna and ran that too for a while.  A short story, to a theme again chosen by popular vote and in fewer than 256 characters; oh, how those creative juices flowed!</li>\n<li>I helped out with @isaacjw's #TuesdayChallenge too, a weekly way for like-minded folks to showcase their artistic skills.  (Me?  I used a child's magnetic board.)</li>\n<li>Oh, and footnotes.*</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's not a big list, and though I <em>may</em> have forgotten something big it's representative of the network's scope.</p>\n\n<p>But, without all those lovely people, none of my activities  mentioned above would have been remotely possible .  I'm conscious of the fact others may have been involved prior to my arrival, but I'm speaking from my personal experience.  And that's the key to ADN, a very personal experience, not shaped by the knowledge someone's looking over your shoulder with a view to monetising your post content.</p>\n\n<p>Best-of-all I relaxed.  I met some wonderful, chatty, clever, insightful, downright amazing people there.</p>\n\n<p>Thankyou all, I'll never forget.</p>\n\n<p>But, to perhaps understand what I'm thinking right now, you had to <em>be</em> there.  I <em>was</em>, it was great.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am @bazbt3 both on <a href=\"https://10centuries.org/\">10Centuries.org</a> (Jason Irwin's burgeoning social/blogging/podcasting network, for which I have invite codes) and on Twitter.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Let's just say I popularised them, albeit in a limited manner.</p>\n",

It qualifies me to say this: to the mountains it's utterly meaningless, to the trees and the squirrels it's irrelevant, and to humans though arbitrary it <em>can</em> be a time for regrouping.</p>\n\n<p>I see people saying it's silly that dates chosen by another age to signify year-end and year-beginning have such significance.  But this regrouping I mentioned is important; maybe even <em>necessary</em>.

Well, it makes a change from attempting to take stuff by force, right?</p>\n\n<p>So I took the girls and Ruby dog and we walked the streets, the girls knocking on doors or ringing doorbells in the hope of getting sweeties.  ok, candy!  They did really well; I'm proud of the way they conducted themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Knock/ring once, wait a respectable length of time, leave the eggs at home in the fridge, you know?</p>\n\n<p>Our neighbourhood did the modern tradition proud.  Loads of homes decorated with pumpkins, ghoulish apparitions swaying at doors, even a smoke machine to add, yes, authenticity to the proceedings.  There were people of all ages dressed in suitably scary attire and make-up (though my costume and features on the night would win competitions anywhere!)</p>\n\n<p>This year (hopefully the foundation for next) my girls got dressed, applied make-up to appear even scarier than normal, and we went out in what turned out to be the perfect evening, spending that very enjoyable hour-and-a-half going from door to door.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure my two brought genuine pleasure to at least 2 households others had passed by, it was really great to see.</p>\n\n<p>And to think this curmudgeon didn't want to go out, to be sociable.

We'd ask for a \"Penny for the guy\" - a vaguely-humanoid shape supposedly representing Guy Fawkes, but in reality a pile of rags and stuffing to be tossed on top of the woodpile and burnt with as much ceremony as young lads could.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest though, I can't remember if we ever burnt a guy.  I recall us burning wood but the predominant memory is the disappointment of having our stash robbed from under outer noses.</p>\n\n<p>Happy days!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The post title is necessarily apostrophe-short, I can't remember how to add one in the post header.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've not had anything to say for weeks now, nothing at least that isn't either political or ultimately objectionable, so I've kept quiet awaiting the reawakening of my muse.  And here we are‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>After the discreditation (too strong?) of the Steady State Theory it is now is generally accepted that our universe is in a state of expansion following The Big Bang.  No matter where scientists look in space things are moving away from us; everything in space is moving away from everything else.  This bit I understand.</p>\n\n<p>The bit I do not understand is simply voiced: there is no point within our universe that can be identified as a centre.  Look, I understand how everything can be moving away from everything else, but there's something fundamental I'm missing out on.</p>\n\n<p>Space is big.  No, bigger than that.  Bigger by orders of magnitude too vast for my simple brain to comprehend.  I'm used to thinking about the journey to work, to the shops, even the distances between my home and the seaside.  The size of space though, it defeats me.  And I have no problem with that, none whatsoever; some things are indeed meant to just be.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the size of space, knowing that space is expanding and everything is moving away from everything else, my personal grasp of basic physics infers that somewhere in our sky there must be bodies adopting a course approximately parallel to our planet or solar system.  No, our galaxy.</p>\n\n<p>Our galaxy is massive and we are an almost-insignificant almost-nothingness at a near-meaningless point within it, of that I've absolutely no doubt.  But science must be able to find an edge, a boundary, beyond which other large conglomerations of stars, dust, black holes and star stuff are moving en-masse, in a direction measurable relative to ours. </p>\n\n<p>I find it unreasonable to suppose, yet at the same time completely plausible to think, that our tiny mote of a world is indeed at the centre of our universe.  Leaving aside broad philosophical arguments centred around the nature of self and being, if there's nothing keeping pace with us it flies in the face of everything I know about probabilities, chance, randomness.</p>\n\n<p>But no, that last bit is wrong.  Flip a coin.  It is either the side you chose or it isn't; I'm being capricious to prove a point.</p>\n\n<p>If everything on the Internet was subject to review, to critique and ultimately approval after 'publication' we might advance towards a multitude of enlightenments as a collection of individual groups but generally as global society.  But who can we trust to review the myriad of words written daily, even in our mother tongues?  Partisanship, religion, simple spite, an inability to differentiate between humour, satire, sarcastic commentary - the need to preserve the intent of those who would make our lives more interesting - all count against what would quickly become censorship.</p>\n\n<p>To make the assertion that something is a fact but without any supporting evidence is as easy as breathing.  To provide the foundation on which a statement rests?  Yeah, somewhat more complex.  Ultimately the assertion will be received by the uncritical without incident, by the remainder with a sceptical eye.  But even this fails to take into account all the nuances of humanity's approach to our interactions when faced with external stimuli at or beyond our limits of comprehension, or past the point of our willingness to engage.</p>\n\n<p>When I started composing this (a few weeks ago!) I'd just eaten my first quesadillas, bought from a supermarket.  I'd asked The Internet with what I should eat them, and a man who knows about such things responded with a suggestion of beans or rice, dipping them in salsa.  Sounds good.  I ultimately chose my own path: an unseasoned (at least not additionally) beef ravioli accompanied my Mexican food.  Tasty!  I'll be getting more, and definitely taking the advice given.  And modifying it; a character flaw.</p>\n\n<p>On the Saturday evening just gone I stayed home and watched a film from my 'list', a film with almost universally bad reviews, a film that makes more sense if one's read and enjoyed the book.  As I have, twice.  AND some of the followup series!</p>\n\n<p>IT'S a film older than both my daughters' ages added together, so why HAVE I not watched it before the weekend past?  But first, what is it? </p>\n\n<p>'Battlefield Earth'!</p>\n\n<p>I reckon it's L. Ron Hubbard's master work (ignoring, that is, the other stuff he's a little more famous for.)  The book is.</p>\n\n<p>The film?  The film's hero isn't cast well, the acting is over the top in places, wooden as a spoon hewn from an immobile wooden thing rooted to an immobile earth in others, but as a hopeful, swords-and-sorcery epic it'll do for me.  Not that I, a dyed-in-the-wool sci-fi enthusiast, can get into the genre easily.  Unless Arnie's in it.  Conan The Barbarian, oh yes.</p>\n\n<p>But Arnie's not in THIS one.  John (occasional massive hits) Travolta is though, as is Forest (solid body of work) Whitaker.  Not Mr Whitaker's finest work, it must be said, nor is it Mr Travolta's.  It's no Armageddon (Bruce Willis), that's for sure.</p>\n\n<p>But it's mindless fun, everything's nicely telegraphed well in advance.  Undemanding.</p>\n\n<p>But; yes, a but.  I didn't cry.  I cry at everything I watch these days, especially kids movies at the cinema.  It's probably not a coincidence that I choose films designed to evoke something primal in kids and their slaves.</p>\n\n<p>But does it get Baz's Seal of Approval?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, why not‚ÄΩ</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean I'll watch ANYTHING with a Rottentomatoes.com score of 3% with a preceding book?</p>\n\n<p>Hell no, and neither should you.</p>\n\n<p>A question: I read the book of another film years ago and loved it, absolutely loved it.  So should I watch 'Hawk The Slayer'?</p>\n\n<p>And will I take your advice if you give it?  If there's only me reading will I take even my own?</p>\n\n<p>What's the worst that'll happen?  Mass extinctions, the end of humanity?  Heh, no!  Time wasting?  Not that either.</p>\n\n<p>Mind expanding?  Yeah, why not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I still haven't bought that bloody diet and exercise book either, another recommendation I'm, er‚Ä¶ working on!</p>\n",

A hero is emphatically NOT someone who kicks a ball for a few minutes each week or runs/swims/cavorts quite fast/energetically - or does both - whilst being paid an entertainer's wage.

There will come a time when even the most hardened Sun or New York Post journalist at least considers giving up. </p>\n\n<p>At least I hope so.  I really don't like this erosion of meaning.  What's next though?</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, languages must evolve, take at least that for granted.  In a lot of cases it's necessary as technology or social change mandates the reduction of complex phrases in favour of a jargon adopted by the general public.  In some cases it's the adoption of trivial, inconsequential, transient words emerging from social media.  In others it's borrowing of foreign words used regularly by a sizeable proportion of those who speak whatever language is evolving.  It seems to me though that dictionary committees are spending more time courting the press than accurately following trends.</p>\n\n<p>Trust and tradition, both are being eroded at rates faster than previously seen.  'Trust' in an age during which words lose their meaning is a bit of a misnomer.  There are a very very small number of people and organisations I can trust without thought.

It's a roller-coaster ride of epic proportions, a film during which I can suspend my sense of disbelief, ignore my engineer's-innate sense that the physics isn't exactly Newtonian, and simply relax into the story.</p>\n\n<p>Not-quite a ritual but I've watched it at least once a year since the film came out on DVD.  I'll never tire of it.</p>\n\n<p>I cry.  I cry every time I watch it.  I cry safe in the knowledge that my emotions are being manipulated by industry-proven methods not limited to‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>No Baz, let's not spoil this.</p>\n\n<p>I laugh too, I cringe, I empathise, I literally sit on the edge of my seat.  Literally, not figuratively; I LIVE the movie.  Sure the characters aren't as fully-fleshed-out as I'd like, but I really don't care.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a typical quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Colonel William Sharp:<br>\n\"Get off‚Ä¶ the nuclear‚Ä¶ warhead.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Awesome.  In the very best sense.</p>\n\n<p>There are indeed a couple of low points: the short cuts between the world's celebrations of the unlikely teams of drillers and bona-fide astronauts seem calculated to tug at the heartstrings.  My disbelief returns.  And there's something else not-quite-believable, but I'm not here to fact-check or find bloopers, no.</p>\n\n<p>The very best bit in the whole film, it's tiny, it's understated amongst the joy and the sheer gung-ho spectacle around it.  'Poignant' is a good word to use at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Truman leads a team of NASA scientists tasked with the destruction of the terrifyingly-big lump of rock swinging round from the depths of space towards the destruction of Planet Earth; something at which I'm sure it would excel without breaking a figurative sweat.  Now, a childhood disability robbed the man of the chance to become an astronaut; nonetheless he followed his dream and made a massive contribution to our salvation.  He believed in the team he was putting together.</p>\n\n<p>Amidst the cheesiness of the concluding scenes after the heroes return to earth he approaches the recently-deceased Harry Stamper's daughter Grace, just reunited with A.J., her love - their marriage finally approved by her dad \"I wish I could have been there to walk you down the aisle‚Ä¶\"‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>A.J. breaks his embrace with Grace, turns to Dan and hands him a piece of cloth, a tattered and charred Misson patch, testament to the trials the team endured:  \"Harry wanted you to have this\".  Dan takes it: \"He did huh.\"</p>\n\n<p>Understated, powerful as anything else out there.  Perfect.  I can feel it now.</p>\n\n<p>And the music starts to swell, a military plane formation arrives, one peeling away as they reach the landing site; it's called The Missing Man Formation.</p>\n\n<p>And then Aerosmith, 'I don't want to miss a thing'.</p>\n\n<p>And then I cry.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>No hidden messages here, sorry dear reader.</p>\n",

State, categorically, that something bad is unacceptable, clamp down on it when evidence of rule breaking is found - and STILL get castigated for being perceived as ineffective?  Politics is a funny old game, especially the current Labour Party's version - of finger pointing and flinging poo.</p>\n\n<p>Until last year when Jeremy Corbyn was elected, things seemed safe, predictable, boring even.  Now the parliamentary Labour Party's raison d'etre is a piecemeal, unfocused, but point-by-point dissection of a man's political evolution.  We live in an age of easy access to things that the ignorant would consider to be facts, things which do not require explanation or interpretation but which, without context, are completely meaningless.  Eager people lap it up; misery loves company. </p>\n\n<p>Many people are thinking that one event in particular shaped this year and all successive years: the untimely death of one man.  A singer, composer, actor, style and lifestyle icon‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Bowie, David Bowie.</p>\n\n<p>Apocalyptic!  Some say he's the Fourth Horseman, though that's twisting things a tiny bit.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's such a thing as responsibility, endeavouring to understand a situation and all its players.  Unfortunately the Labour party's voluntary fracturing exhibits no evidence of this.</p>\n\n<p>Deserting one's posts then blaming the leader of one's party for a failure to vote against, or at least to defend, one's party's principles?  I've only one word for it.</p>\n\n<p>Despicable.  Ok, thinking about it, two words: despicable and classless.</p>\n\n<p>Under normal circumstances a shadow minister tasked with overseeing opposition to the government would do their very best to mobilise against the full range of harebrained schemes the Tories, er‚Ä¶ incumbents cobbled together from whatever pot of idiocy these things are stirred in.  Opposition depends on team players.</p>\n\n<p>Much like Monty Python's 'fearless' knights though they ran away.  Not in a comedic style but in a tragic 'let us run away then blame it on our leader' manner.  Responsibility requires sacrifices, demands that respect is earned.  The Labour party's response: restricting supporters from voting, demanding a frankly ridiculous sum of money (lots of ¬£25 sign ups totalling &gt;¬£4.5 million), and suspending all branch meeting until the election - it's classless.</p>\n\n<p>Blaming Flappy Bird's WallyWorld* constituency office attack on their leader, then suspending the entire branch (at a time when all meetings are outlawed anyway): classless.</p>\n\n<p>Expecting that their leader should shoulder the blame for the alleged, or real, subsequent intimidation and death threats: it's utterly classless.</p>\n\n<p>Revisiting a utopian ideal, anyone who considers themselves 'normal' would say it's a noble thing to aim for a classless society.  Well, we got one.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Some names have been changed to protect the challenged.</p>\n",

Nothing really happens in the play it's true, but it's the WAY it happens that makes the play so compelling to watch.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, much as it has been for most of 2016 thus far, world events took over my evening as the news of Turkey's ill-fated coup attempt filtered through.</p>\n\n<p>No-one seemed to have predicted the military actions, just-as no-one predicted the Nice terrorist's appalling act.  Nice inspires us to say that 'something must be done'; Turkey though, Turkey is a puzzler.</p>\n\n<p>First it's a good idea to examine Turkey's recent but  gradual swing of power away from democracy to executive order.  The country is in a unique position, strategic in terms of regional defence and in terms of being crucial to European expansion.</p>\n\n<p>Over time Turkey's importance has only grown; there's too much at stake for too many partners for the inevitable crackdowns, reprisals, there to elicit more than an odd 'tut' from other governments.</p>\n\n<p>Right away, before the implications had time to settle in the minds of foreign governments (all of whom had condemned the coup) the Turkish President dismissed just shy of 2,750 judges and placed the blame for the coup squarely on the shoulders of an exiled religious leader.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair this exile has been deeply critical of the current government.  However he's stated his lack of involvement in the coup and condemned its use of violence.  The Turkish President still wants his return though.</p>\n\n<p>US interest in the region requires the use of an air base and Turkish airspace.  The Turks, to put pressure on the US to extradite the exiled critic have restricted access to this base.  The USA has responded 'of course you can have him, but show us some evidence of his involvement.'</p>\n\n<p>Not a pleasant time for anyone concerned.</p>\n\n<p>A surprising thing occurred on Friday.  Not the numbers of citizen journalists broadcasting via Twitter, not the clumsy takeover of national broadcast networks by the military, nor was it the swift shutting down of most Internet services for ordinary people, nor even the President's and local leader calls for the citizens to go out into the streets and stare down the army, no.  The most surprising turn of events was the President turning to the Internet to appeal for assistance from the people.</p>\n\n<p>Taking into account his distaste of it and his recent desire to restrict it at home, does it perhaps seem a bit two-faced to use it to achieve his own ends?</p>\n\n<p>Everyone has a right to change their position over time.  For a government to shift ideologies when it suits them simply seems unjust.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest pretty much everything surprises me these days.  Not the coup attempt, that at least followed a pattern established during the twentieth century.</p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Turkey's inherent volatility, placed as it is at the meshing point of physical, ideological and religious boundaries, makes it an interesting choice for inclusion in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Repression of the Kurdish minority, of freedom of expression at home, of the secular in favour of the religious, making laws banning foreign subjects from criticism of the President (laws apparently enforceable by dint of treaty obligation outside of Turkey!), his own security detail assaulting protesters in a recent US visit - all these things are antithetical to the ideals of EU membership, the ideal of democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless Turkey remains a necessary bridge between The West and the Middle East and The East.</p>\n\n<p>Oh how I wish it was a bridge a Troll didn't live beneath.  The price to cross is almost too great.  But at least there's some good news: Russia sided with the incumbent government.  Yeah, good news‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>For much of the year thus far, the news has not been 'good', not been kind to us ordinary people.  </p>\n\n<p>Every celebrity, musician, playwright, actor, novelist, politician, every one will eventually pass away.  It seems that the first half of this year brought us an almost-unbearable number of 'em actually doing just that.</p>\n\n<p>Viewing this and the changes on the US and UK political maps one could assume that someone discovered the secret of life, the universe and everything, and that consequently our universe has been replaced by something for even more improbable.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone should read Douglas Adams' Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy - a trilogy in five parts, just as everyone should watch Waiting For Godot.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have a theory.  These things can only make sense at either a specific time in one's life or after a required number of life experiences have passed.  Has to be said: I'm really looking forward to getting the remaining 97% of experience points, or however these things are measured!</p>\n\n<p>Two men, waiting by the side of a road, waiting for a man to come, the purpose of his visit unclear.  Two men with opinions on and an understanding of everything and, at the same time, nothing.  No, right now I can't think of a direct link  from the play to what's going on in the world right now.  In general terms though; their attempts to make sense of even the limited stimuli present in the almost barren, desolate landscape around them parallel my clumsy attempts to understand politics, the strife we see all around.  And life.  Mixing a couple of metaphors here, maybe the drip feed prior to the advent of the late twentieth century news firehose would have suited me better; the genie's out of the bottle though, and our wishes are almost spent. </p>\n\n<p>Stage plays, where were we?  My last 3, with the most recent first: Waiting For Godot (YouTube), 'The Scottish Play', and a farce during which a man got his knob out on stage.  Well yeah, at least my exposure to CULTURE is going the right way! </p>\n",

No hope of ever getting them to change their attitudes, so in thrall are they to the bigots who elect them and pay for their advanced weapons systems.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot begin to imagine my life being shaped by the influences that cause someone to become a terrorist. But what I can do is attempt to at least understand why.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not about to start down that road right now, not in a blog post. Mine isn't a knee-jerk reaction shaped by the latest news, the cause forgotten about in a desire to have someone else do something about it. Something quick. Retribution.</p>\n\n<p>Even in my comfortable existence I've not forgotten one fact, apparently beyond the wit of a sizeable proportion of the people commenting on the Nice killings of Thursday 14th July 2016‚Ä¶ And all the other atrocities carried out in the past in the name of our freedoms to give us our comfortable lives.</p>\n\n<p>It's a statement that covers a multitude of 'sins.'</p>\n\n<p>Religions don't kill people, people kill people.</p>\n",

I've looked at both sides of the argument and concluded that, though my vote is on the 'losing' side, I did the right thing.</p>\n\n<p>Pointless me going over that again, I'm not a prolific blogger, my recent post history speaks for itself. </p>\n\n<p>Reading lots of informed, ill-informed and decidedly un-informed and thus blinkered commentary on this unique situation in which we find ourselves brought home a number of facts.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone who voted did so to attempt to make a very real difference in the way this country works.  Regardless whether this was the time to protest or not, from what I've seen, most think it's enough.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know, I'm inclined to agree.  But only upto a point.</p>\n\n<p>I can't see everyone who voted 'Leave' OR 'Remain' voting in the next election.  I say next election because, obviously, this vote wasn't one.  An election.  It would be wonderful if the UK could grow the level of support for our newly-discovered sense of democracy.  My fear is simple, that turnout will be in the 30%-40% range at the very next opportunity.  It's a real possibility unless a General Election is called.</p>\n\n<p>Challengers to Brexit have appeared today in the shape of the well-known law firm Mishcon de Reya.  Operating on behalf of a number of companies opposed not to the vote result itself but to the insistence that the government and Parliament simply HAS to accept it, the firm has already been in touch with the government's lawyers.</p>\n\n<p>To me this at least pauses the steamrollering of common sense.  Whether the challenge is accepted and allowed to progress remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<p>A number of challengers for the Tory Party leadership battle appeared quickly.  I've heard a fair amount from The Backstabber, from I've Real-world Experience (in the finance industry), little from the Home Secretary, zero from the Man Who Thinks Homosexuality Can Be Cured, and zero from the Disgraced Former Minister.</p>\n\n<p>Repairing the bridges between Leave and Remain won't be easy, and may prove impossible dependent on future government policies.  Repairing the balance between the regions, or maybe CREATING a balance between the regions must be a priority, whoever wins whatever trivial leadership battles we see unfolding before us.</p>\n\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, who wins these contests proves irrelevant.  Policy changes little whichever party is nominally in control of our money.  Er‚Ä¶ whichever party has our best interests uppermost, sorry about that slip.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few days I've thought carefully about joining the Labour Party.  Yes, simply so I could vote in its leadership election - for that principled man Jeremy Corbyn.  Not some fly-by-night politician changing his ideals dependent on which way the wind blows or from which direction the money comes (though the Labour Party, like any other, does indeed have some pretty influential groups throwing loadsamoney at it), he seems genuinely committed to making things better for us.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line though, in this uncertain climate I just can't expose my wallet to the current fees.  At ¬£3 it would have been a no-brainer.  At a one-off ¬£20, yeah, why not.  At just shy of ¬£50 though it merits serious thought.</p>\n\n<p>Kaiser Wilhelm, the last German Emperor, believed that Germany's place was at the top of the pile.</p>\n\n<p>A sentiment I'm sure echoed by the British (English!) throughout all the years the empire expanded.

Ah, crap analogy.</p>\n\n<p>Sure other nations' leaders want the best for THEIR people, it's common sense.  We must go into this respecting their wishes, sovereignty.  Saying that only someone who voted to leave Europe is capable of getting the best deal is complete madness!

				"content_text": "<p>Stepping backwards in time around 35 years, to another period of desperate uncertainty, the time of strikes and industrial discord, I'm reminded of a computer game I played a lot.  'The Hobbit'.</p>\n\n<p>Under normal circumstances I wouldn't be looking back to such events but these aren't normal times, not by a long way.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the point about adventures is not everyone is cut out for adventures.  Just like the Hobbits, some of us British thought it'd be a great idea to venture out into the world beyond the safety of The Shire.  It sounds a noble thing to do, to assemble a band of like-minded travellers, none particularly well-suited to the unknown but all SURE it will go well.</p>\n\n<p>Deep down, they know the reality is likely to disappoint, to scare, but their friends carry them along.  Friends won't let friends down, there's nothing more certain than that.</p>\n\n<p>East.  East was a direction one had to take to progress, but a direction leading one deeper into darker situations.  Trolls, Goblins and Wargs - wolf-like creatures, a giant spider, a dragon, and even scarier creatures, yeah, the stuff of legend.</p>\n\n<p>Rest easy though, there's a happy ending - there were enough allies available during the journey to make a difference to the eventual outcome.  Read the book, read it to your children.  Read it before the books are burned.*  We British went east, east into Europe, our tale doesn't look likely to end well‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Lemmings.  I've seen more than enough references to lemmings in  cartoons and popular media, but the cartoonists got it wrong.  Understandable, lemmings are more in tune with the British psyche, being at least identifiably European.  They're not but that's a minor detail.  </p>\n\n<p>Actually, lemmings running off a cliff was a clever stunt by Disney, a stunt to perpetuate a legend rather than to put one to rest.  Disney chucked hundreds of lemmings over a cliff.   And filmed it.  Yay, Disney.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we aren't lemmings, lemmings aren't us.  We're buffalo.</p>\n\n<p>\"Deep blood kettle\": a loose translation of the Blackfoot tribe's word for a buffalo jump cliff.  Not so much a cliff for buffalo to jump off but one off which a herd was forced to fall, either killing the animals outright or incapacitating them until they could be killed by the native Americans.  The principle was simple: panic a few at the back, drive them in the right direction, those at the front won't stand a chance, pushed along by the sheer weight of numbers behind.</p>\n\n<p>Sustainability though was, I believe, the key here.  It'd be utterly pointless for the tribe to kill off an entire herd.  What happens next year?  And the next?  Starvation or the necessity to become nomadic?  A stark choice.</p>\n\n<p>\"United Europe has been a curse.\"  \"We've become complacent, reliant upon other people to make decisions for us.\"  \"Those decisions were never in our best interests, especially the laws to enhance personal wellbeing and safety.\"  \"Europe will decline and drag all with it.\"  \"Those nasty European bureaucrats!\"  Yeah‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Common complaints by people who who haven't studied Europe as deeply as I have.  For the last 6 weeks.  Off-and-on.  Makes me an expert.  Yeah.  Ok, so I've spent a little more than that, but‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that no-one likes experts or facts anymore fills me with dread.  I've noticed my attention span diminished over the years as my recreational use of the Internet increased; more precisely my ability to place events in a time-related context.  Expecting others to look back to a time before they became self-aware is very selfish of me.</p>\n\n<p>Deep down I know that it's pointless to attempt to educate people that the worst is NOT over; that though the pound has indeed rebounded against the Dollar (and the Euro), and though the FTSE 100 has indeed stabilised, and though‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Oh, what's the use?  Farage and Boris and Gove jointly pulled the sword out of the stone already. </p>\n\n<p>Now what?  Now the sword is out, what can we do with it?  Is it shiny and radiant and pure and does it sing of greatness and‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>King-making is out.  Our society doesn't work like that any more.</p>\n\n<p>Eye-for-eye justice systems, etc. all gone, consigned to a time in history when things were just simpler, more predictable.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the Black Death focused the nation's collective mind, likely brought along social and economic change in a way nothing previously had.  And the industrial revolution, forever changing society from self-sufficiency to a reliance on others‚Ä¶ but conflict remained.</p>\n\n<p>Battles with other belligerent, territorial, nations - predictable, understandable.  Let's see those fingers lads!</p>\n\n<p>Ahhh‚Ä¶ maybe I should let things take their natural course and stop worrying.  I am but one man.  Writing to my MP brought zero hope.</p>\n\n<p>Let's see what we have.  Take stock.</p>\n\n<p>Long ago in a land far-away lived a middle-aged man.  He gambled with his country's future.  He lost.

What is there, what are we not doing already, that will establish us as an economic entity trading from outside Europe?</p>\n\n<p>I was probably wrong in thinking we must invent new industries post-Brexit.  I was probably wrong on thinking that we need to dramatically shift the way we think about trade to make us more attractive to the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>New industries: if it were that easy we'd have done it by now.  There's nothing from Europe stopping us.</p>\n\n<p>Trading differently: I don't know.  Tariffs imposed by the rest of the world's trading blocs are likely to be the decider here; we must trade at a rate advantageous to both sides.  'Great' British pride must not stand in the way of hacking out a deal.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know how long negotiations will take.  Our best bet is simply to roll over and accept the terms allowed to Norway, Switzerland and soon Canada.</p>\n\n<p>So why money, why am I not looking at immigration?  I've heard, so many times, that 'we're full!'</p>\n\n<p>No we're not, not by a long way.  When was the last time you were unable to leave your home because the street was packed full of people?  When did you fail to get your shopping due to mile-long, er‚Ä¶ kilometre-long checkout queues?</p>\n\n<p>Not full, see.  Poorly-distributed.</p>\n\n<p>Theres no doubt that areas across the nation see an influx of immigrants and naturally resent the erosion of their way of life.  </p>\n\n<p>We're struggling to maintain access to essential services for everyone, but that's not the fault of immigrants.  Yeah, sure if there weren't any we'd have full employment, no need for a minimum wage and zero-hours contracts, the NHS would be fully-staffed and open 7 days a week, we wouldn't be shutting hospital accident and emergency units and merging maternity units, no.</p>\n\n<p>It's about the distribution of money.  The north fares badly.  HS2 won't benefit us for decades, if ever, if it's ever built.  The Northern Powerhouse is a Big Society bedfellow - a thing that removes government from decision-making and pushed it onto local government and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Inequality.</p>\n\n<p>But still, what money do we have?  Can we spend the ¬£350,000,000 per week allocated to Europe?</p>\n\n<p>Allocated to, not sent.</p>\n\n<p>Last year the government took in ¬£533,373,000,000 in tax.</p>\n\n<p>Divide that by the Europe money multiplied by 52 weeks per year, divide 1 by it, and multiply the result by 100.  What do you get?</p>\n\n<p>3.41 - the percentage of our tax receipts allocated to Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Wow.  Allocated to not sent, but still A Big Number.</p>\n\n<p>What do we get back, what's the net total we give to Europe?</p>\n\n<p>Already the Welsh and Cornish are asking that the government matches the grants received from Europe - grants used to preserve their food, language and customs for future generations.  The farmers and fishermen will follow, and the engineers, artists, broadcasters, tourism organisations‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>The ¬£350,000,000 allocated to build one hospital per week looks in danger of being eroded a bit already!  Oh dear.  Maybe we should settle for building 50,having 2 weeks off for Christmas, and using the leftover money to staff the hospitals instead!</p>\n\n<p>It won't work but it's a start.</p>\n\n<p>¬£350,000,000 multiplied by 52 is itself a quite large number.</p>\n\n<p>¬£18,200,000,000.  Wow.</p>\n\n<p>Cornwall most recently took 0.33% of that.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's ignore what we get back from Europe and concentrate on what we SEND there.</p>\n\n<p>Well, from fullfact.org:</p>\n\n<p>\"In 2015 the UK government paid¬£13 billion¬†to the EU budget, and EU spending on the UK was¬†¬£4.5 billion. So the UK‚Äôs ‚Äònet contribution‚Äô was estimated at about¬†¬£8.5 billion.\"</p>\n\n<p>But wait, ¬£350M per week is ¬£18.2B - what's happening there?  An instant rebate, albeit negotiated, that's what, but still considerably less than the ¬£350M figure per week quoted ad nauseam by the Brecon camp.</p>\n\n<p>A net contribution of ¬£8.2B.  What's that per week?</p>\n\n<p>¬£157.7M per week.  Wow.  Maybe we should just cut back our hospital building programme, to perhaps 21 per year?  Not looking as good now, is it?  That's still preserving a Christmas break; important to note, that.</p>\n\n<p>There are all kinds of savings to be made though:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Members of the European Parliament,</li>\n<li>Bureaucrats employed on European stuff,</li>\n<li>Er‚Ä¶ that's it, right?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As time passes my certainty diminishes that I'll not see anarchy in my lifetime.  My wish erodes to see a bright future for my girls.  The belief that as a major player in a major co-operative movement we can shape history and nations for the better is eliminated in favour of observations of narrow-mindedness.</p>\n\n<p>Songs/song titles of our times:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Anarchy in the UK: The Sex Pistols.</p></li>\n<li><p>Road To Nowhere: Talking Heads.</p></li>\n<li><p>Love Will Tear Us Apart: Joy Divison - and some lyrics for you:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\"When routine bites hard,<br>\nAnd ambitions are low,<br>\nAnd resentment rides high,<br>\nBut emotions won't grow,<br>\nAnd we're changing our ways,<br>\nTaking different roads.</p>\n\n<p>Then love, love will tear us apart again.<br>\nLove, love will tear us apart again.\"</p>\n\n<p>I hope mine is an overreaction.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I AM still scared.</p>\n",

Instead I'll, hopefully without penalty, post a part of 'Psycho Killer', a song by Talking Heads, my all-time favourite band.</p>\n\n<p>But first I must say I'd thought of using 'Road To Nowhere', 'Burning Down The House', the really rather good '(Nothing But) Flowers' - this last has all in its lyrics.  'Making Flippy Floppy' was so close to appearing here.</p>\n\n<p>I bought nearly all their studio stuff, Talking Heads that is, at least once, on cassette tape, CD, digital downloads (iTunes); and the Stop Making Sense DVD - a tour-de-force of concert filmmaking.</p>\n\n<p>Favourite song?  None.</p>\n\n<p>'Once In A Lifetime' comes close, especially now, especially given the likelihood we'll get another chance at shaping our country's future.</p>\n\n<p>Heck, the songs (let alone the name of the band as a metaphor for all the celebrities popping up to take sides, voice opinions) could easily form the basis of a post-apocalypse documentary film soundtrack.  It's worth remembering though that, within reason, any lyric can be shaped to fit any theme, should you wish it.</p>\n\n<p>And so, finally, to 'Psycho Killer':</p>\n\n<p>\"I can't seem to face up to the facts,<br>\nI'm tense and nervous and I can't relax,<br>\nI can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire,<br>\nDon't touch me I'm a real live wire.</p>\n\n<p>‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>You start a conversation, you can't even finish it.<br>\nYou're talkin' a lot, but you're not sayin' anything.<br>\nWhen I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed.<br>\nSay something once, why say it again?\"</p>\n\n<p>(time passes‚Ä¶)</p>\n\n<p>Awesome.</p>\n\n<p>If this resonates because you live in the USA and cannot quite believe it's still months until Super Tuesday rolls around, you may find it applies to your (coughs) Trump (coughs) epoch-making situation too!</p>\n\n<p>At least here in Europe we do things on the cheap.  Hundreds of millions of pounds/dollars raised from well-meaning folks and spent on ads rubbishing the opposition?  Barefaced lies?  Deeply entrenched views based on arguments utterly devoid of logic?  No.</p>\n\n<p>Er‚Ä¶  Maybe.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, our politicians also share with us the promise of jam tomorrow.  Oh yes.</p>\n\n<p>I'm betting it'll be rhubarb.</p>\n\n<p>Would you care to bet against me?</p>\n\n<p>Next up, 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' by Joy Division.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've read a lot of pro- and anti-Europe opinion pieces.  I've read all the literature that's come through our letterbox.  There's an inescapable conclusion to be made after a period of reflection.  And here it is.</p>\n\n<p>It's all guesswork.</p>\n\n<p>No-one knows what will happen if we Brits leave the European Union.  That's no-one knows.</p>\n\n<p>I don't mind the scaremongering: highlighting the inevitable lack of border controls, loss of political and policy control, a likely increase in our contributions as less-well-off countries join Europe, the deals allowing foreign companies to sue to establish privately-run footholds in currently state-owned services‚Ä¶  Scaremongering is, after all, what we pay our politicians for.  What I do mind is the sunny picture being painted, of the benefits greatly outweighing the negatives were we to leave.  Guesswork, all of it, based on our past.</p>\n\n<p>It's utterly pointless looking backwards to a time when Britain was actually great, to a time when we ran the known world - at least the world that other European nations didn't control.</p>\n\n<p>It's pointless looking back at a time Great Britain made stuff that was exported all over the world; essential items that no-one else in the world could make, or at least make well.  Our very real contribution to the Industrial Revolution is indeed something of which we can be justly proud.</p>\n\n<p>We gave it all away.  Processes, designs, specific inventions that grease the wheels of world industry; we relinquished a very real control at a time we had sway over vast numbers of far-flung nations, an authority over those 'backward' folks.  Sure it was the authority of the gun, club and bayonet, but hey, we punched way above our weight, and we can do it again right!  But, as the rights of the 'indigenous' people correctly became more important than our colonialism, we lost that control.  It must have been utterly humiliating for the politicians of the day.</p>\n\n<p>The Twentieth Century was perhaps the era of biggest change, at least as far as benefiting the average Briton.  Healthcare improved beyond recognition thus life expectancy rose, personal wealth rose, the welfare state protected those unable to look after themselves, the rights of the common man were improved immeasurably - a template for the rest of the world to build upon.  We rebuilt after the deprivation of the Second World War, suffered greatly through rationing until we emerged, victorious again!</p>\n\n<p>Ok, our contributions to world peace and stability were obviously misguided, a side-effect of both being on the winning side in those 2 World Wars and those prominent rose-tinted spectacles.  We probably meant well.</p>\n\n<p>We don't have to look backwards too far to figure out when things started to go wrong with the British economy.  British politicians decided it was pointless trying to improve the lives of other British people by ensuring a stable working environment and making things the rest of the world wanted.  So we simply gave up.</p>\n\n<p>Making things better than the rest of the world is hard.  Why bother?  Far better to invite bankers to do business here, to concentrate on making things attractive for service industries, filmmakers, motor racing car designers, makers of killing machines‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Killing machines; we've a proud history of making those at least.  And jet engines, hovercraft, vacuum cleaners.  Er‚Ä¶ ok, bad examples, those 3.  How about textile machines, motors, ships, trains, cars, aeroplanes, computers, televisions, tyres, er‚Ä¶ Oops!</p>\n\n<p>I've seen videos 'explaining' how things will be better once we can negotiate our own trade agreements, free from the shackles of European regulation.  Good luck with that, if we're trading with firms in European countries that are bound (emotive word?) by European regulations.  Or ISO standards.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck trying to negotiate a trade deal with next US political administration; either the  mercurial (I'm being kind) or the known.  The USA, rightly in my view, isn't known for its generosity towards other nations when so much is wrong at home.  Major industries shuttered or mothballed as cheaper foreign competition bites.  It's going to be the same here, us versus our European neighbours.  And vs China.  And vs the rest of the world.  All of it.  Back-of-the-queue-Britain.</p>\n\n<p>Really, what have we to offer that can't be done cheaper elsewhere?  Take a long hard look at numbers, probabilities.  Ignore those who promise it will simply be 'better', that we can return to the nation of Saint George, Boudicca, King Arthur, that guy who was the nominal boss before the Normans took over, Chamberlain, Churchill, and all the others who made a difference when it comes to an understanding of what it is to be British.</p>\n\n<p>English actually.  That's what all this is about.  Nationalism.</p>\n\n<p>It's easy to invoke a pride in one's nationality, to remind the great unwashed masses that we've always been a nation capable of triumphing against insurmountable odds.  Easy.</p>\n\n<p>Insurmountable odds like The Charge of The Light Brigade, Dunkirk, The Battle of The Somme‚Ä¶  Yeah, you know where this is going.  The point is this; those were much, much simpler times.  There was a defined objective, not many variables, the path the opposition would take could be predicted, to a degree.  You'll have heard of, or know a little about both Chaos Theory and Game Theory already so I won't bother explaining here.</p>\n\n<p>Ah, but the competition were still learning their trades.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone's guessing what will happen if we exit Europe.  Guessing; there's no other way of dressing this up.  Those pro-exit are either amped up on nationalistic fervour and hope their persuasiveness will carry us through, or sufficiently well-off to be insulated from it.</p>\n\n<p>Me, yeah, I know where I stand.  I haven't a clue!</p>\n\n<p>What I have is a cautious approach.  I've 2 young daughters so I've a father's concern that my actions now will have a direct result on their futures.  Its entirely silly to think like that; their future is out of my hands.  Its everyone else with definite opinions, those with an unshakable belief that their exit vote will make us great again, that will guide us in a month's time. </p>\n\n<p>If it goes wrong, it's probable that most already past retirement age won't see the worst of the fallout.  Heck, if things play out like I'm imagining it won't be a pleasant world as the various trade blocs realign in a external market tariff-laden but 'buy local' fashion.  It natural.  Besides, no matter how much we don't want it to happen, the Far East is indeed emerging as the world's economic powerhouse.  Er‚Ä¶ It's emerged.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I read something yesterday, a rebuttal of one part of the exit camp's trade arguments.  Our re-taking of our World Trade Organisation seat once we're out of Europe.  We've been WTO members since 1995, have that and another swat due to our European position.  If only people fact-checked before jumping to conclusions.  It takes seconds, minutes at most to; yet why research, why study when faith works just as well and is quicker to boot!</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of studying stuff,  students (young people) - in theory the most likely to vote to remain - are up against it.  Polling day is outside term time, see.  The advice is to register to vote in 2 locations (family home and halls/digs) if undecided where you'll be on the day.  A recent poll indicated most students don't seem to know when Polling day is though!  Surely not someone's cunning plan.  Surely not.  No.</p>\n\n<p>One final thing, ok, set of things.  I keep seeing people's worst-case scenarios.  You know, those where we take a few years to establish even better trade links with the world, where the British economy carries on at the same level as now then improves and we become great again, free from the shackles of oppressive regulation and crippling financial contributions.  Some expert sits in front of a Parliamentary committee and says it's it's going to be great, guarantees it.</p>\n\n<p>Why people still trust people who stand behind a teleprompter and pretend they can see into the future; still trust people who've spent a lifetime convincing others that their philosophy is best, better than that other party's or their own party's factions; still trust those who've presided over or been a party to scandal after scandal, and who either express mock outrage or seem immune from retribution - it saddens me.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not advocating a revolution, a British Spring.  Far from it.  I'm simply wondering why objectivity doesn't matter any more.</p>\n\n<p>I'm scared.</p>\n\n<p>What are we actually good at, better than anyone else by a sufficient margin to guarantee sustainability?</p>\n\n<p>I really don't KNOW.</p>\n\n<p>That's why I'm scared.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This week, at work, I started the process of choosing an NFL team to follow.  I've been here before.  Not too many times in recent years, thankfully, but I have more motivation this time around.</p>\n\n<p>It's 12 years since I was last serious about the sport of American Football.  Lives intervened.</p>\n\n<p>Besides, such is the active lifespan of a profession sportsman - especially an American Football player - I'm guessing that everyone I knew of at that time will have retired.</p>\n\n<p>Messy thought processes follow immediately:</p>\n\n<p>Rather than begin the search this time by grappling with rivalries between the teams of people I know, I decided to apply a bit of lateral thinking; I asked Google for advice!</p>\n\n<p>\"nfl team chooser\" is the search criterion I employed.  A sensible starting point.  I'd hoped to be guided by question and answer sessions and I was not disappointed.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the first 3 pages of results provided me with 15 usable sites, or at least choices.</p>\n\n<p>The company's IT infrastructure firewalled the tenth hit as 'tasteless', and the 2 random selection processes picked the Giants (discounted immediately, because reasons.)</p>\n\n<p>I answered a good number of questions on the sites; some general 'what's your favourite colour' through questions assuming trivial general Football knowledge, to team balance and squad selection.  Some I'll freely admit I had to guess at - especially those needing current squad knowledge; I get only 1/2 hour for lunch, and the season's approaching fast!</p>\n\n<p>I got a list.  A list of 12 teams.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than list 'em here I'll simply mention I applied a simple statistical analysis: tallying by Conference and Division.  Simple.  None in NFC South; one each in AFC East and North, NFC North; two each in AFC South, West, NFC East; three in the NFC West.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting, that last one.  I'd been mulling over choosing the all-new LA Rams - the only team in that division not picked by my scientific* approach.  I was a fan of the 49ers not long after I started watching the sport.  I looked forward to seeing their Super Bowl 'Threepeat'.  When they failed me I needed another team.</p>\n\n<p>An underdog!</p>\n\n<p>The Cowboys' preceding 1-15 season made my choice easy.  I watched the Jerrys' team go all the way.  Satisfying, that.</p>\n\n<p>I did other things too, about which I've previously blogged.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, this is where things get complicated!</p>\n\n<p>Here.</p>\n\n<p>We had visitors at work all this week.  From Topeka.  Kansas.  USA.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah.  They were united in their recommendation:</p>\n\n<p>The.  Kansas.  City.  Chiefs!</p>\n\n<p>I'll be honest, I'd never really considered supporting AFC teams.  The pre-champion Bills and Broncos both came closest.</p>\n\n<p>Underdogs both, see.</p>\n\n<p>So, a toss-up between 2 teams: The Los Angeles (recently ex-St Louis Missouri) Rams, or the Kansas City (Missouri again!) Chiefs?</p>\n\n<p>The Rams are currently rubbish though their move might, in time, fix that.  The Chiefs are currently quite good, thus might automatically disqualify themselves.</p>\n\n<p>I need a set of playoff rules.  Would a whole season be appropriate?  A period of observation, hoping I can choose at the end. </p>\n\n<p>September to January.  32 games, though my choice will likely be made much earlier - a performance-related bonus.  Playoffs would be pleasing but hey, I'll be happy enough if I last the course.</p>\n\n<p>One big thing; the Topeka guys mentioned sending me a Chiefs Jersey.  A great gesture, one I definitely appreciate even if it doesn't happen.  Why?  They started a train of thought, and that's better than any outsize sporting garment!</p>\n\n<p>As, potentially, the newest fan they know I'm already aware that chaos theory will inevitably make an unwelcome appearance.  Whilst I wouldn't necessarily object being the group scapegoat (I am, after all, thousands of miles away) a 'No pressure' existence suits me better.</p>\n\n<p>At least for season 1.  I'll need time to acclimatise.</p>\n\n<p>But indecision is easy.  A tiebreaker might be needed.</p>\n\n<p>So now, finally, to bitter rivalries.  Which team's fans harbour the strongest, burningest, most long-standingest hatred for the Chiefs‚ÄΩ</p>\n\n<p>A rhetorical question?  Nope.</p>\n",

Oops!</p>\n\n<p>Social burnout.</p>\n\n<p>Most here will have a social networking networking history, may even identify personally with Jason's words‚Ä¶  For me it's a case of 'the wrong time of year'.</p>\n\n<p>For you‚Ä¶?</p>\n\n<p>Choice.  While I had only IRC and MS Chat, that's all I used. IRC was a one-day thing for me; i can't recall <em>any</em> actual interactions at all.  Literally one day.  I got online and, within the first month explored every protocol and service available to me as a new Microsoft Network (MSN) customer.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I forgot to mention ICQ in my blog post; a service I used mainly to connect to people I <em>already knew</em> online.  In real time.  Mine was, probably still is, a 6-digit user ID.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays though we've dozens of places we can go to express ourselves.  There are social networks, forums, niche services‚Ä¶  There we can chat about our desires, hopes, dreams‚Ä¶ with other like-minded people, hopefully without troublemakers intervening.  Most of us want a quiet life when we want a quiet life.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, that.</p>\n\n<p>So, App.net (ADN); it's a place with lots of good memories, good people, but it's been let down by its founders and those in search of a bigger audience.</p>\n\n<p>Now mine's not a massive criticism.  I'm hardly there at all, my feeling's more one of a remembrance of the emotional baggage stemming from the SOTN post, the frankly-ridiculous antagonism (I'll never understand why people don't simply block) and the network's inevitable subsequent decline.</p>\n\n<p>And guilt.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not doing #QuoteSunday (always a low-engagement thing) in part due to IFTTT's ADN support shutting down, nor am I running #ThemeMonday (once an entirely different proposition.)</p>\n\n<p>That reminds me, I should really move the #ThemeMonday page at my site and replace it with‚Ä¶ Sometime.</p>\n\n<p>I must examine my other social network profiles linking to ADN, to see whether I must move them to where I'm most comfortable calling my social hub.</p>\n\n<p>Or must I?</p>\n\n<p>A perhaps-telling FYI; Last year, despite others not doing, I upgraded my ADN account to 'Developer'.  More of a statement of intent, a gesture, an attempt to pay back in‚Ä¶  I developed nothing of course but got a vague sense of wellbeing, and a hammer to add to my bio.  THIS year I downgraded.  To an 'ordinary' paid user account.  Not all the way to '40'.</p>\n\n<p>Hollow.</p>\n\n<p>But here I am at 10C, with a Premium account paid-up until 2017 (over the top of Jason's invite) developing an 'app' for 10C. How odd.</p>\n\n<p>So, back to the blog post. Burnout maybe, but I'm happy to call 10centuries.org (10C) home.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to bear in mind; I'm crap at publicising stuff; hence the <em>one</em> successful invite. Kinda successful, I'm hoping the guy I invited will spend a bit more time at 10C‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>And that others will follow.   There's nothing to lose.  No ads, no spam.  Really. </p>\n\n<p>And here be (more) Adventures! Maybe.</p>\n",

During the time since I've noticed a shift in the way I approach social media.

I've also been experimenting with rudimentary self-hosting.</p>\n\n<p>As this has happened I've been neglecting both my blog and those people who comment on the posts.

It was awesome, it was perfect with its green LED display.  It just worked.  Little did I know at the time where it would lead me‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>To live in an age of such rapid technological advancement is a constant source of wonder for me.  Though the transistor predates me by a significant number of years, the miniaturisation it enabled brought possibilities unimaginable a few years earlier.</p>\n\n<p>My dad was an electronics hobbyist; his life spanned the time after the creation of the first thermionic valve devices, through the transistor revolution, through amateur radio enthusiasm, right up to the home and business computer boom.</p>\n\n<p>He might have viewed younger generations' disdain for learning about the technology which makes things 'just work' and their 'need' for the newest, fastest, best devices their parents (or disposable income) can buy.  He wasn't, as far as I can recall, an old curmudgeon, he simply liked to get his hands dirty.</p>\n\n<p>So do I, to a point; but I'm as guilty as the next child in wanting 'improvements.'</p>\n\n<p>I did my bit in the nineteen-eighties though.  Computer hobbyist!  My third computer had a rich collection of programming languages available, and so I used most.  It had analogue/digital interfaces, and those briefly opened up a whole new world to me.</p>\n\n<p>I typed magazine program listings 'in', fixed the typos introduced by the technologically-illiterate publishers, and adapted the knowledge I gained to create even <em>better</em> routines.</p>\n\n<p>Heck, I even flowcharted my programs!</p>\n\n<p>I designed <em>and built</em> a digital joystick (microswitches) and, from rotary potentiometers and microswitches, an analogue joystick <em>and</em> a baseboard-mounted 2-arm graphics tablet.  I wrote software to control what happened onscreen, taking inputs from the‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>I messed about with a few variants of BASIC, played with Forth, Pascal, steered around <em>anything</em> to do (with (Lisp's braces)), and even dabbled with 6502 Aasmbly language (a text character Space Invaders clone that ran <em>way</em> too fast to play.)</p>\n\n<p>And then life got in the way, though I <em>did</em> play games during the interludes between life and work.  Programming was largely forgotten, consigned to history.</p>\n\n<p>We don't need to create stuff nowadays though; talented developers, designers, creators - they can do it all <em>for</em> us.  Pick up a modern computing device - computer, network, tablet, phablet, phone - and stuff is but a quick download away.  Life is easy.</p>\n\n<p>Things indeed just work.  There's the expectation that they just work, but a very basic lack of understanding of the 'how.'  It's fine, I recognise that not everyone had the desire to spend time, is capable of, designing a program to do even the simplest of tasks.  Life is easy for a reason - we're standing in the shoulders of giants every time we breathe, it seems.</p>\n\n<p>Ive been blogging - stream-of-consciousness style - of my Raspberry Pi Linux playtime.  I started with the intention of creating a niche blogging aid, yet the 'something' that's followed me from the early nineteen-seventies persists still.</p>\n\n<p>I could blog on any number of host platforms, yet I choose to restrict my words to four:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I <a href=\"http://git.bt3.com\">self-host.</a> This option brings by far the most enjoyment, but it's fraught with unforeseen technical difficulties and the need to slide a learning curve. </li>\n<li>I use <a href=\"http://bazbt3.github.io\">GitHub Pages.</a>  Slightly less complex, though I used the framework the service provided as the base for my self-hosted site.</li>\n<li>I use 10Centuries v2.  A personal project by Jason Irwin, it saw a fair amount of traction with App.net users, me included, for its simplicity.  It's in the process if being superseded.</li>\n<li>I recently started to use <a href=\"http://10centuries.org\">10Centuries v4</a>, v2's successor; and would very much like to migrate all my v2 posts there eventually.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>10Centuries isn't simply a blogging platform though, there's:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blogging (of course),</li>\n<li>Podcasting - almost painless,</li>\n<li>A burgeoning social network (posts are Blurbs, not Tweets.)  Until this weekend the network was a limited private beta, everyone followed everyone else, but now it's about to expand - with a limited number of user invites available,</li>\n<li>Developer access to the 10Cv4 API (application program interface!) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've already had a brief play with the API; created an app authorisation token, and then an access token to interact with the API before my first 'hello world' post - at which point my head asploded!</p>\n\n<p>It's not every day I'm programming on a computer controlled by the computer on my lap.  (SSH is magic, pure and simple.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm not alone attempting to develop stuff.  Fortunately everyone <em>else</em> has relevant skills!</p>\n\n<p>For its freshness, newness, openness and all-round friendliness I can easily recommend 10Cv4.  It's a place that both promises and <em>delivers</em> on the promise that App.net emerged with and, to a degree, still retains.</p>\n\n<p>Owning your data, no ads, no sophisticated algorithms to re-order posts in what often seems like a totally random manner elsewhere - all powerful draws.  It worked for me.</p>\n\n<p>The 'paint is still drying' on a few features, some are in a state of rapid development and heck, some aren't even implemented yet!  But there'll be nothing obvious getting in your way.</p>\n\n<p>If you're like me and simply want to chat about 'stuff', have no <em>message</em> to spread, no desire to attract legions of followers just for the sake of numbers, then 10Cv4 is for you.</p>\n\n<p>If you're dissatisfied with the state of <em>your</em> social network (or 'social' in general) and want a change, a fresh start perhaps, <strong>and would welcome my invite</strong>, let me know!</p>\n\n<p>Don't expect me to be there all the time, or be a social network evangelist though, I'm spreading myself too thinly as it is!  Neglecting <em>you</em> on more than one network is weighing heavily.</p>\n\n<p>But I'm having <em>fun</em> and that, for me, just works.</p>\n",

Ok, in my case it's because they've shrunk in the wash...

I'd had a brilliant idea - a Eureka moment (but without the nudity and attendant spillages.)  Here's the brief exchange:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As an engineer I‚Äôm bound by a code of professional conduct to suggest a solution to the jumper hue issue; a daily palette based on the colours of the rainbow.  In ascending frequency order, and by day.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately though, my purple one today falls outside the rigid boundaries of the, it must be said, unfortunately limited scheme.  Your flagrant Thursday jumper today merits a red card I‚Äôm afraid, though I‚Äôm sure you could carry the visible spectrum off better than I were you to try harder.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôd better start work on version 2.0.</p>\n\n<p>Baz.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reply came a little later.  I'd <em>honestly</em> not expected one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Hi Barrie,</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for your email.  Well, what can I say?  I‚Äôm disappointed with myself that I have got off to a bad start on the first day of the week, but I do feel that I need to correct you on something.  Your jumper hue is not purple.  I do believe it‚Äôs a wine/beetroot shade, but definitely not purple.  </p>\n\n<p>Whilst I appreciate and do accept the card, I can‚Äôt accept a red one.  Red is just not my colour.  I don‚Äôt do red and that‚Äôs that.  Red is not good for us gingers, I‚Äôm afraid and as I am too bound by a professional code of conduct as a ginger, you will simply have to come up with another colour. </p>\n\n<p>I eagerly await your palette‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Have a nice day,\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Me, speechless, though not apoplectically-so:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"*Baz stills sense of outrage, <strike>stands</strike> sits corrected, starts work on v2.0.1*\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The conciliatory response came an agonising-for-me 50 minutes later:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I must say that the beetroot/wine colour does suit you though.  A warm colour for these Wintery times.  I would even go as far to say that it‚Äôs perhaps a burgundy.  There‚Äôs not many who can carry such a shade off.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Awesome.  And, with that, order in my universe was restored.</p>\n\n<p>Which was nice.</p>\n",

You may need to create one for this step to work best!</li>\n<li>Find and fork the 'poole/hyde' repo, calling your fork [your GitHub username].github.io - </li>\n<li>Remove the entry (all the text) in the <code>CNAME</code> file and save it back to your repo.  This forms one half of a redirect from a domain external to GitHub Pages.</li>\n<li>Customise the fields within the <code>_config.yml</code> file and save it.  This effectively personalises the new site.</li>\n<li>Edit the post within the <code>_data</code> folder.  This is to test whether the basics are working.</li>\n<li>Browse to <code>[your GitHub username].github.io</code> - and you should see something superficially like poole/hyde and my sites, but with your content.</li>\n<li>Fix anything that doesn't quite work.</li>\n<li>Success!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you don't see what you like, it's not a massive amount of work for anyone with any previous programming (at any level) or HTML background to work stuff out.  Knowing a bit of Markdown - to edit and format your posts - will help.</p>\n\n<p>I've changed stuff and added a few things to the basic 'framework', such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the site name font (I know a tiny amount of CSS, not enough to break stuff, but I always do and have to revert.)</li>\n<li>An 'Archive' page, basically a copy and paste from the jekyllrb.com site, but formatted to add post excerpts.</li>\n<li>A 'Reading list' page, a simple loop reading data from a .csv file.</li>\n<li>Other stuff.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once you get into this, the ideas flow quickly.</p>\n\n<p>But, despite all this enthusiasm, faffing about‚Ä¶  my primary blog still resides at Jason Irwin's 10Centuries - <a href=\"http://bazbt3.re-app.net/\">here.</a></p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<p>Because there's more to blogging than fiddling with site nuts and bolts, SEO, testing, etc. - it's all about the <em>writing</em> for me.</p>\n\n<p>Besides, <a href=\"http://10centuries.org/\">10Centuries v4</a> is due soon (currently in invite-only beta) and that's an <em>entirely</em> different ballgame!</p>\n\n<p>Despite my what it states in my App.net <a href=\"http://app.net/bazbt3\">bio</a> I am #NotADeveloper.</p>\n\n<p>But it helps to have a basic understanding of what it takes to <em>be</em> one.</p>\n\n<p>A clear mind.</p>\n",

I'll be honest though, I just wasn't <em>old enough</em> to 'get' Punk Rock.  That said, 'Never Mind The Bollocks' became one of my most favourite, most played albums‚Ä¶ </p>\n\n<p>I inherited a desire to explore from my parents.  Not the 'grand' pith-helmet type of exploration, not the canoe up the Amazon type nor the temples and ancient artifacts variant of open-seas pirates, no.</p>\n\n<p>A desire to not go on holiday, laze about all day, get a lobster tan and return home after a conventional 2 weeks, extolling the virtues of the local beers and stinky sausages, and appearing from the holiday snaps to have enjoyed every minute.</p>\n\n<p>My only pool/seaside holiday was my honeymoon; but that's a tale for another time.</p>\n\n<p>Until 1992 we as a family had never left the United Kingdom, not even the mainland - apart from the flight to The Isle of Man for an, er‚Ä¶ regulation 2 week annual holiday.  We always found something to do.  Always.</p>\n\n<p>My dad passed away first, sadly (from my perspective at least) without a repeat flight.  By the time mum left us we'd still been abroad only twice; coach tours to first West coast USA then, the following year, East coast USA &amp; Canada.  Fan-with-a-capital-effing-an-tastic!</p>\n\n<p>Friends asked if I'd like to go on an Egyptian your; you know, THE Pyramids, cruise down THE River Nile, Karnak, balloon flight‚Ä¶  Egypt is an amazing country - and one I hope to return to one day with my family.</p>\n\n<p>One day, one day‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>That same year, a USA tour from Washington DC through the South and departing from Dallas TX.  The year after <em>that</em> another USA tour, this starting in Denver CO, south through the American Rockies into New Mexico then West, departing from Phoenix AZ.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of years later, with a mate and feeling a little more confident, a week's American Football tour around Ohio; my first, and so-far <em>only</em> fly-drive holiday.  Football, beer, noise and driving on the wrong side of the road just because we could.  Bloody great!</p>\n\n<p>A year later, with my wife-to-be, a very special Egyptian tour.  <em>This</em> time I did not escape the Pharoahs' curse; the Siwa oasis hotel's on-entry-room-smells-of-poo experience simply <em>has</em> to be experienced.  And I did.  For the next week-and-a-half.</p>\n\n<p><em>Then</em> we took three cheap mini-cruises; overnight ferry, day in a European city, ferry overnight back home.</p>\n\n<p>Tours hand it, whatever <em>it</em> is, to the tourist on a plate.  All the lazy traveller must do in return is not antagonise one's fellow travellers.</p>\n\n<p>Easy.</p>\n\n<p>After all that, to mention I'd never visited my own country's capital city (2 hours by train) until October last year might appear a <em>little</em> odd.</p>\n",

I have no doubt that all have enriched my life by some variable, though small, amount‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>I led a happy childhood; not the rose-tinted view of a time ripe to be torn asunder upon discovering a dark secret much later in life, but a <em>genuinely</em> carefree time.</p>\n\n<p>Allowed to play out; free rein to go as far as my and my childhood friends' imaginations would allow us, we had it all.  My parents, both working class (not that it matters), made sure I always had enough to occupy me and that I was safe‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>There's no doubt it was a different age.</p>\n\n<p>The television then wasn't by any means new, but I remember our black-and-white set and the occasional moir√© pattern leading me to think colour was, impossible as it sounds, just about to break through!</p>\n\n<p>It never did.</p>\n\n<p>The number of TV channels wouldn't have retained a modern consumer's attention for more than a few minutes.  Throughout the <em>entirety</em> of my childhood we had <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_the_United_Kingdom\">three (3) channels</a> to choose from!  My parents picked our programming wisely, using the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_TimesTV\">Radio Times</a> &amp; radio guide <em>extensively.</em></p>\n\n<p>There are too many things to list, but a brief conversation earlier reminded me of the magic of 1970s TV.  Of particular significance, though I wouldn't expect many to understand why-for-me <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vz01e1wB898\">the unmasking of professional wrestler 'Kendo Nagasaki'</a>; an amazing bit of television unlikely to be repeated today.</p>\n\n<p>To fill the entertainment void between TV programmes and living our lives we listened to the radio; music, lots of it, and BBC Radio 4 for talk, news and of course drama.</p>\n\n<p>We had a record player with a storage capacity of, er‚Ä¶ ok, capable of playing 78s, 45s and 33-1/3 vinyl records.  Amazing sounds from a black plastic disc, and <em>especially</em> the rich, unsurpassable bass and frequency range when played on my Auntie &amp; Uncle's 'Radiogram'; from-memory almost identical to the one at the top of this <a href=\"http://wishhound.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/radiogram-days.html?m=1\">'Radiogram Days'</a> page.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, rather than me telling you what my parents and I listened to, just take a look at that page.  It sums up the era perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, to give you a clue, my parents had me later in life than the average.  I listened to a vast range of music, first theirs and gradually as my tastes developed‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>A range spanning my Dad's jazz to songs from the shows, rock &amp; roll, classical to avant-garde, through the big band sounds to American easy-listening to‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Ok, given a <em>huge</em> range of influences I chose as my first single‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Elvis Presley's 'Suspicion' - I suspect because, faced by the unaccustomed freedom and the choice in the shop, I simply couldn't <em>decide</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But then my teenage years arrived and with them the train-wreck of inevitability.  Of <em>course</em> I stepped away from the earlier path set up by my mum and dad.  Had to; to establish my sense of 'self', or something.</p>\n\n<p>Music became an important part of my life.  Unfortunately the path I chose through its many genres, styles, influences, wasn't the same as my mates, colleagues, family.  No matter, it helped my sense of identity grow.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I was a bargain hunter, regularly rummaging in Woolworths' wire baskets to find the stuff no-one else wanted.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this evening, a little while before my Bluetooth headphones' charge <em>finally</em> ran out, I was at a loose end and searching for something 'different' to listen to.</p>\n\n<p>Looking through the albums I'd queued up on Amazon Prime Music, Isao Tomita's <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflakes_Are_Dancing\">Snowflakes Are Dancing</a> stood out as something I'd grabbed to stream eventually, but <em>at the right time.</em>  It's an album of Claude Debussy's music, Tomita's being a 1974 electronic variant - and one I remember listening to as a child, bought by my uncle when still brand-new.</p>\n\n<p>It's one that captivates me still.</p>\n\n<p>So why now?</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, it's the right season to reminisce; and though year-<em>ends</em> usually bring out the strongest emotions, this music has opened up a good-few links back to my dim-and-distant past.</p>\n\n<p>Its all good; it made me who, and what, I am.</p>\n\n<p>To everyone who contributed to the making of this blog post: thanks!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Blogging is simultaneously simple and complex.  The simple bit is writing something interesting.  Or simply writing.  The complex bit is, er‚Ä¶ a bit complicated, obviously.</p>\n\n<p>I write for myself, my most critical audience.  I attempt to let the stream of consciousness flow from my brain to my fingers without much impediment.  Choosing the topic helps immensely here; I made the decision years ago not to stray too far into religion, politics, world affairs, security, race, sports, and things I obviously know nothing about.</p>\n\n<p>I have failed, and will fail, at my attempts at self-censorship.  'Contentious' is <em>not</em> my middle name.</p>\n\n<p>Given those apparently insurmountable obstacles to popularity it's a wonder <em>anyone</em> reads my blog.  <em>Really.</em></p>\n\n<p>In the place of writing for wider appeal I write about myself, family, experiences likely to be shared with a not-me reader, and stuff.</p>\n\n<p>I write and post at a time that suits me; catering to my closest readership.  I pick titles that serve to remind me of the content behind.  Or is it below?</p>\n\n<p>In late November 2015 I started to blog daily, responding to the installation and early use of a daily journal app on my phone.  My daily streak lasted a whole and previously unprecedented month; which was nice.  After that miss I've done well; another streak is ongoing.</p>\n\n<p>It's not about streaks; it's about enjoyment, a process, a journey.  Getting there, wherever there <em>is</em>, is almost incidental.</p>\n\n<p>Focus on the minutiae of blogging for a moment - the technical aspects of the sport - is something I've mastered in the past, a couple of times with WordPress and, more recently, with Jason Irwin's 10Centuries (10C) blogging platform.  Ok, so there's not much to fiddle with using Jason's service; so I fiddled with CSS anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, prior to the 4th generation of 10C going live, I'm messing about with Github Pages - it's a surprisingly rewarding process getting things to work.</p>\n\n<p>Blogging and administering via Git (even with help from the Github.com web interface) isn't for everyone, though with suitable Git apps it's really quite easy after a while, especially using a good Markdown editor.</p>\n\n<p>I've refrained from asking Jason to add a Git repo posting method into his already complex mix.  The ability to post via an ADN private message, or via the 10C Web interface or using Evernote <em>or</em>, in v4, Microsoft's OneNote, probably gives existing and potential users enough options to gain wider appeal.</p>\n\n<p>(Other services exist, YMMV.)</p>\n\n<p>I am Baz.  I am still not a blogger.</p>\n",

I've spent the last few years being consistent in my approach to it, even with the obvious discord it engenders.  I've honestly thought I've being doing the right thing.  Apparently not.</p>\n\n<p>Today though, something remarkable happened...</p>\n\n<p>For a long time I've been threatening (yes!) to throw toys away.  My wife hates the idea and, even when I've implemented the threat in the past it's ultimately failed for a number of reasons - not limited to rescuing whatever's in the bin or forcing (yes!) me to do it.  I've apparently been unreasonable.</p>\n\n<p>Perspective may be a worthwhile thing to introduce at this point?</p>\n\n<p>We're overrun with toys of all shapes and sizes, spent paper &amp; card, paint pots &amp; brushes, pens &amp; pencils.  Every room in the house apart from the 'master' bedroom, toilets and bathroom has mess wherever the girls (nearly 7 &amp; 4) finish what they're doing.  Bedrooms are occasionally, in a very real sense, impassable - bedclothes, dressing-up clothes, toys strewn across the floor, beads and sharp pointy things underfoot to cause maximum discomfort to unwary adults.</p>\n\n<p>One of the very worst things to deal with is the horrendous number of stickers that appear on every surface in the house.  They stick to furniture, floors, are run through the washing machine, clog the vacuum cleaner, stick to work clothes, to bare feet and cats...</p>\n\n<p>It's been going on, as I mentioned above, for a few years now and despite my best efforts the lessons I've been trying to teach simply haven't sunk in.  It would be fair to say that my wife and I don't exactly see eye-to-eye on matters of child discipline.  You could say I've gone way past the point of being reasonable about it, but without any visible improvement using other methods (naughty step included)¬†I thought it would eventually pay off.</p>\n\n<p>Today though I'd just had enough.  I'd asked the girls to get all of their art stuff together and make a pile of it, and put everything else in another pile.  We'd then figure out between us what to keep and what to throw out.  It worked until I figured out I'd got in the way - at which point I'd made the mistake of believing both girls' suggestions they'd have it done soon.</p>\n\n<p>An hour later, and 2-1/2 hours in to the exercise, and after frequent reminders I gave up.  No, I hadn't expected concentration for that amount of time, there'd been breakfast, juice, a bit of telly as a temporary reward...</p>\n\n<p>So, all of the stuff not already sorted into the 'art stuff' pile went in bin bags, ditto all of the other toys.  All this while the girls watched and asked awkward questions.</p>\n\n<p>Then, the remarkable thing: my wife didn't stop me, nor did she suggest the toys shouldn't be binned.  You could have slapped me down with a small wet fish!  Amazing!</p>\n\n<p>To spare my oldest daughter the pain of seeing her toys going into bags my wife decided to take her shopping - there's a rather important milestone-y family birthday party next weekend, and we'd also nearly run out of ketchup!  My youngest daughter can still be bribed with TV, so that's what happened whilst I 'tidied up' in the back of the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>The back of our kitchen has in the past been called 'The Morning Room' (previous owners) and by us 'The Breakfast Room' (though we've never really used it as such), and now it's 'The Area' (christened thus by the girls) for art and general messing around.  It's been allowed to fill up with colouring books, sticker rolls, beads, aprons, discarded paint pots, brushes, and especially completed works of art...</p>\n\n<p>So all the paper and card and felt and plastic went in bin bags, and with it anything I deemed unusable.  Anyone more sentimental than I would have baulked at destroying their children's precious memories, but not man-of-steel here, no.  I thought about the implications, of course.</p>\n\n<p>My wife and oldest daughter returned home from the shop some time after I'd finished.  I helped with the unpacking, feeling good about something for the first time in a week-and-a-half.</p>\n\n<p>We had another brief chat about what I'd done, she suggested sorting through the toys later - a not unreasonable thing to do given the circumstances - and I put the last bits of shopping away.</p>\n\n<p>You could say that the morning had occasioned a cathartic response in me, the result of which¬†is the 4 (yes four) bin bags (items taken only from the front &amp; dining rooms and 'The Area') waiting next to the outer door in the utility room for my wife to sort out later.  And, more-importantly for my sense of well-being, a sense of a job well-done and a feeling of an achieved consensus.</p>\n\n<p>Success!</p>\n\n<p>The very last item out of the very last shopping bag - another pack of stickers.</p>\n",

I'm not challenging anyone else to do it, nor am I demanding they forfeit large sums of money if they fail.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people won't bother to ask what the Ice Bucket Challenge is <em>for</em>, concentrating merely on the social dimension.  A lot will do it and donate to their favourite charity.  Most, I hope, will donate to the MND/ALS charity in their region - and have fun doing so.</p>\n\n<p>There's no sugar-coating this, so here goes.</p>\n\n<p>Me?  I've painful memories of my dad's last days to battle with. It's enough.  Ok, so I donated ¬£25 this time round.  No fanfare, no fuss, just went online and pressed buttons.</p>\n\n<p>There's no escaping the simple fact that Motor Neurone Disease is a fatal disease.  The odd exception stays around for longer than most but it's not much of a life.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly twenty eight years after his death in hospital some memories remain undimmed.  Not the kind that return on seeing a nearly-forgotten photo.  Not those based solely on the photo with no memory of the actual event, no.  Powerful stuff.</p>\n\n<p>After the diagnosis my dad knew. And knowing, he gave up, or at least that's how I remember it.  There's no shame in that, no recriminations from the people he left behind.  None.</p>\n\n<p>When your wife and son have to wipe, wash, dry and dress you, when eating becomes difficult, when breathing becomes a strain, the very very worst thing remains - the mind is‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>My dad did crossword puzzles when other pastimes became impossible.  He did them in his head.  Let's face it, no longer being able to hold a pen can't be much fun.  He'd struggle to make himself understood when we filled the words in but upon completing the grid together the sense of achievement, the triumph, the bright eyes - if only for a moment - gave me an inkling of how important this achievement was.</p>\n\n<p>I also remember the good times - that's the important thing to remember here.</p>\n\n<p>¬£25 seems a pitifully small sum of money to give, especially if the current massive outpouring of goodwill advances the understanding of MND/ALS and eases the suffering of those whose lives it destroys.</p>\n\n<p>Please don't make the mistake of thinking you can have a bucket emptied over your head and then give your money to just any charity - the biggest do not need your money right now.   Cancer affects much greater numbers.  Fighting cancer is important.  Everyone I know has someone in their lives who's survived, or succumbed to The Big C.  Yet‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>The effects of natural or man-made disasters are, nowadays, there for all to see - often within a scant few hours of the events happening.  Such things are often forgotten a scant few hours or days later - there's no personal connection thus the average human simply can't grasp the impact.</p>\n\n<p>More fleeting events such as, oh I don't know, the continuation of famine and poverty worldwide caused by the diversion of funds away from those who need them most, cause me to stop and think.</p>\n\n<p>Just after the shock of 9/11 I donated money, like many, to the American Red Cross's appeal.  My donation was misplaced.  Blood donations had to be destroyed as the existing infrastructure was unable to cope.  A vanishingly small percentage of the blood got through to 9/11 victims.  Sure it swelled their coffers but‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>I failed to donate after Hurricane Katrina wiped out much of e.g. New Orleans.  If the richest country in the world cannot look after its own why should I, a man of moderate means living in the UK, even think of doing so?</p>\n\n<p>There's nothing wrong with donating time or money.  There's nothing wrong with feeling better that you've helped by giving money.  I'm not going to get into 'Liking' or retweeting though - suffice it to say I know people who think pressing a button HELPS!</p>\n\n<p>Right now it's great that MMD/ALS is, even tenuously, high in the public's consciousness.  Don't be an arse and say they're 'stealing' from more established causes.  Don't try to justify your charity's position by saying 'no-one OWNS #icebucketchallenge.'  Some little person somewhere managed to do something innovative without the benefit of advertising departments and focus groups - and it worked. Just accept it.</p>\n\n<p>There's nothing wrong with a spur-of-the-moment donation either.  On this 9/11 (ok, 11 September 2014) a Manchester, UK dogs home was the victim of a nasty, cowardly arson attack which killed around 60 and caused a massive surge in donations.  By lunchtime the day after ¬£622,000 (a cool million US$) had been raised.  It easily doubled in the few days following - something that no-one could have predicted.</p>\n\n<p>\"Think first, donate later.\" It's how I operate now.  I happen to believe it's the responsible way to approach the thorny issue of wanting to do something good whilst staying within the confines of an ever-shrinking pot after all the bills have been paid.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This post originally aired 20 September 2014.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I like 'The Internet.'  I like it a lot.  I interact with an at-glacial-pace-decreasing-number of the myriad of services available 'on' it as I understand more about what I need from it.  It wasn't always thus but since Q1 1997 I've found it to be indispensable.</p>\n\n<p>Google is my friend.  I resisted the temptation to sell my soul to it for the longest time.  And then I signed up to everything.  I resisted the call of Facebook for years and, though I'm yet again deactivated there, when I fell I found it useful.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter and App.net (ADN) - different services, different uses.  In the same way that I found Twitter to be at first exciting and for the moment and then restrictive because of the post character limit, I find ADN to be a place I can contemplate my timeline and relax into the higher character count.  No-one would ever describe my posting style as abrupt, terse, or concise.  Certainly not inflammatory.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly everyone on ADN behaves like adults, even those not legally entitled to be called such by dint of their age.  Nearly everyone has silly moments.  Nearly everyone, even when arguing about deeply-held beliefs, is courteous and, I believe, most attempt to allow discourse instead or riding roughshod over what they believe to be opposing factions' opinions.</p>\n\n<p>There are of course, an odd number who fail to hold to the high standards I set*, but I recognise that if an individual holds a particular viewpoint strongly-enough it's pointless to try and change it.</p>\n\n<p>I even like it when things go wrong and apologies are made and attempts made to fill the cracks instead of papering over them.</p>\n\n<p>I emphatically do NOT like being told to shut up and compared to a naughty schoolboy for engaging in a discussion about a subject that pains me.  I'm an adult and can behave as I choose, when I choose, and where I choose.</p>\n\n<p>In my entire adult life no-one apart from my wife has told me to shut up and escaped my undivided attention.  In my 17 years online, no-one has ever told me to shut up - apart from a Russian youth on Twitter who misunderstood my attempts to help solve a problem because I misunderstood his poorly-phrased question.  The stream of unnecessary invective thrown at me led me to the inescapable conclusion he'd recently discovered English sweary stuff and I was in the right place at the right time - for him.</p>\n\n<p>One attempt at conciliation over, blocking was easy.  These days though, well, I have less time to piss about around hopeless causes.</p>\n\n<p>I care deeply about maintaining a positive and so-far-lifelong approach to fairness and tolerance, the same towards race and gender issues - and, trivially, not taking sides in Apple vs Android and other similar silly stuff - an approach that my parents instilled in me from an early age.  Not beat into me with a big stick but showed to me with their love and kindness.  I've been extraordinarily lucky that my life hasn't been blighted by nastiness, apart from the torment inflicted by one particularly difficult managing director.  By the same token I've not yet achieved president-of-the-world status - but happiness means different things to different people.</p>\n\n<p>It's not an exciting approach.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who knows me understands something of who I am, and may even understand most of what I mean here. Anyone who doesn't could take the time to learn.<br>\n¬†<br>\nBut not everyone gives a damn. And, do you know, that's fine - the Internet is, after all, big enough for everyone.  I have no objection to people saying what they like, when they like, where they like.  Where views repeatedly and negatively impact others and the torment caused could be avoided by a moment's reflection, then there comes a point at which engagement should cease.</p>\n\n<p>I have another philosophy.  It's closely linked to something I wrote above.  I complain.  I complain about lots of things.  I complain about the weather, the speed of the internet, poor web design, my iPhone 5's excellent battery life [edit may be required!], the traffic, the weather again, food, the abysmal choice of television despite the eleventy trillion available channels, Eastenders (UK), the decline of Dr Who post-Jon Pertwee and again after David Tennant, the crap ¬£35 tablet we got as a first for our youngest daughter and which I recently inherited as we upgraded her to first class, envelopes that don't seal with my saliva, the new picture frames we must buy special hooks for, the speed at which my unattended cups of tea cool, motorists driving past past the speed limit with their phones clamped firmly to their ears prior to parking on the pavement on the yellow lines, the weather yet again, the price of bread, my stupidity in not retaining the entirety of my Asimov novel collection, hospital food and signage, the‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Ok, I complain.</p>\n\n<p>You may have heard of the Psion Series 5, a brilliant but inherently unreliable portable pocket computer, way ahead of its time and genuinely useful.  I'd owned it's precursors, the also unreliable but brilliant Series 3 and 3a.  When the 5 arrived I saved and saved for and then and spent loads of money on it.  The next logical step, I needed some home banking software to get my finances in order.  I tried a few and eventually came across Nigel Bamber's Home Bank.  It fitted me well, but not perfectly.  I outlined the possible improvements to Nigel and, do you know, he agreed.  He changed the program and I fell into his cunningly-laid trap (not true, I volunteered) and spent time designing icons for the bloody thing.  I think my name may be in the credits somewhere if anyone still has a working example.  Though not a complaint, I attempted to help, and found the process very satisfying.</p>\n\n<p>It's pointless listing the number of times my subsequent and little ideas have subtly changed stuff, even usually for the better.  I'm no improvement machine when all's said and done.</p>\n\n<p>I also shout.  I shout at the cats, I shout at the girls, at my wife, at aeroplanes, idiot boy racers with stereo systems more powerful than their car engines.  If the moon annoys me one day‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Shouting is a waste of time, energy and opportunity.  I never, ever, rubbish genuine attempts to improve.  My daughters (4 &amp; 7) often struggle against what they see as insurmountable odds.  They share a silly dance, running around the room, hands waving high, shrieking \"It's impossible!\" It should be endearing but‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Spelling was a problem for the oldest.  Maths still is.  Obviously, we all start from zero knowledge and get better, all at our own pace and often despite the best efforts of professionals an an incompetent parent (e.g. me!)  She's become a voracious, and I really do mean voracious, reader.  Her stories are really good too.  Short due to her age, her lack of concentration, but good.  They show imagination possibly beyond her years.  Her expression and grasp of words when reading out loud - it's a joy to me.  To us.</p>\n\n<p>We got her end-of-year school report today.  She's not perfect but I was so, so proud reading it.  'A' grades for effort all the way down.  Imagine me sat there with a big, silly, grin and tears rolling down my face.  With her at 7 years old being exposed to an idiotically-extensive and advanced-compared-to-my-40-year-old-studies, you know what?  I don't care about the occasional 'average' grade for attainment.  She TRIES!  Proud.</p>\n\n<p>This unwarranted emotion may have something to do with my wife being in hospital.  But looking across and, for today, having no-one to share this with right there and then‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Before bedtime this evening the same oldest daughter rushed out of the room and cried.  She wouldn't tell me why. Stood there with tears pooling in her eyes, and then sobbed.  So I applied the hot poker and forced it out of her.  The non-trivial cause of the angst: a picture she'd been working on using a dark blue felt-tip pen had gone wrong.</p>\n\n<p>A quick Google Image search and some well-chosen Leonardo Da Vinci sketches to the rescue, a chat about the evolution of a painting from outline (say pencil) sketch through shaded image to‚Ä¶  I now have a sketchy portrait (pot belly, beard, moustache, reading glasses, interesting hair) waiting to be completed tomorrow and then coloured in.</p>\n\n<p>(Unfortunately the spreadeagled man complete with anatomically-correct thingy appeared not far from the Mona Lisa whilst scrolling through Google Images, but nudity's not a big thing here.  And thankfully the appendage doesn't yet appear on my portrait.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm a rubbish parent though.  Occasionally a complete, total, and intransigent arse.  I can catalogue every flaw in my personality and the way each impacts both of my lovely daughters.  Do I improve, can I improve with age?</p>\n\n<p>Well, you can bet I try my very, very best to get it as close to right, as close to fair and as close to consistent as I can.  So yes.</p>\n\n<p>But, when all's said and done, an arse remains an arse.  Me - I'm a good wiper.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Reverse-self-deprecation gambit.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>If you abhor politics in all its forms look away now. This is an edited repost from 2012 - written at a time when the illusion my vote could change things, lots of things, had been bent out of shape. It might help your decision to click (or not) if you know I live in the UK. An interesting footnote (in a post without footnotes) the deceased, well-respected local personality and ex-MP referred to towards the end became a tad less well-respected after this post appeared. It's entirely-unrelated to this rambling post, you'll be pleased to hear.</p>\n\n<p>Sit down, I hurt my back on Thursday so I've time to write whilst I'm recovering. I'm in a foul mood too.</p>\n\n<p>I've voted Liberal Democrat all of my life.¬†Technically speaking I've voted for the Liberal Party too. I am, depending how you slice life, currently in my mid-forties and thus old enough to remember the merger with the SDP. I once voted Green, when everyone else was talking about doing so and then subsequently did. I've missed voting maybe twice, apathy is an extremely powerful force. I am, ultimately, uniquely qualified to talk about my voting past in a way no-one else can.</p>\n\n<p>To prove a point, this:</p>\n\n<p>Why have I voted Liberal Democrat (LibDem) all of my life?</p>\n\n<p>I actually believe in the party's central principle of fairness, equality, of not pandering to vested interest. Before you ask, I've read up on their principles, their national, regional and local manifestos. I reckon I'm a social Liberal Democrat with occasional leanings towards the Orange Book creed (or whatever you call it.) That explanation might be enough for you, most folk, however here goes‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>I first voted for the party because my mum and dad did. Upbringing has a major effect on character and aside from my many character flaws (see my wife, children, cats, friends, colleagues, neighbours, acquaintances, etc. for the big list) I think I'm a fair advert for the way my parents lived their lives. When I stopped voting LibDem because mum and dad did I started voting thus because I made a decision¬†to.</p>\n\n<p>Two party politics fails to address the essential problem with a system centred around, er ... two party politics. Extremes. We bounce from once set of divisive policies to another, always ultimately at the expense of the very people adding their 'X' to the ballot paper. People believe change is good, so vote for the opposite party to the one they believe is causing their woes. There's never been a middle, sane, ground.</p>\n\n<p>My LibDem votes, while not exactly wasted, didn't seem to me to make much of a difference to my day-to-day life, but I lived in hope.</p>\n\n<p>And then, before the seemingly-interminable preamble to the last General Elections hit the mainstream media, there was sanity. An alternative that was germinating in the minds of the public. The Liberal Democrats. My chance to make a difference had arrived! Voting was no longer enough, I wanted to join the party and, in a small way, help out locally. So I did. Join. Helping out? We weren't given the opportunity‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Now, the local party when I was a member was and, in my opinion still is,¬†extraordinarily badly run. They've missed pretty much every opportunity to¬† engage with voters when opportunity's there staring them in the face,¬† knocking on their door and (insert other metaphors for the bleedin' obvious¬† here.)</p>\n\n<p>Social media and the web, these days, can play a massive part in helping the general public shape their views on politics. A few clicks and, if interested parties have done their jobs, opinions can be formed.</p>\n\n<p>Knowledge, as they say, is power.¬†The links to Heywood &amp; Middleton's LibDem party site, for instance, lead to its host's holding page. Pisspoor.</p>\n\n<p>So ... The recent local election candidate had no leaflets published, and had, along with every other candidate/councillor/human being zero presence on even the local party's web site. I asked her for her 'manifesto' for local politics and, receiving none (though she welcomed questions,) suggested she complete a pitch on an independent local news site.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of asking only 5 of the 19 LibDem candidates had 'pitches' (brief bios, manifestos) published. Not even the party leader's husband, I believe an ex-councillor and once-aspiring MP had one! Pitiful. Last time I looked there were 7, including our local candidate. Yay, she listened! <a href=\"https://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/elections/election-pitch/809/natasha-akhtar\">Here's her 'pitch.'</a>¬†It's actually worth a read and converted me from being 'not bothered' about voting to, well, I voted for her. What else could I do but place my mark in the 'right' place?</p>\n\n<p>This ward had 175 LibDem votes, down from last year's 511.¬† Not a single LibDem candidate got elected. There's 5 left in the town. Obviously related to the backlash against the national party, but testament to the¬† obscurity of the candidate and the running of the campaigns. It's a shame, but obvious even to me that things would go this way.¬†Last year's candidate, by the way, is now in London, apparently pursuing a career that, I suspect, would have taken him away even if elected as a local councillor here.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the thing ... Why should I, as a concerned amateur, have to point out the obvious ... that publicity has a direct influence on the electability of every candidate. Knowing nothing about someone doesn't exactly endear one to them.</p>\n\n<p>So, I did my best, I got involved.¬†Where did it get me?</p>\n\n<p>My integrity and party loyalty was, on Twitter, called into question by the local Liberal Democrat party leader. She called me a liar for alluding to the local party's previous inadequacies, accused me of using an email she sent me (detailing the candidate's political CV) against the party. I'd already thanked her for it and used nothing from it. Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>She accused me of not being a true Liberal Democrat, of using abusive language ... and mentioned to Tim Farron MP, Liberal Democrat Party President, that I'm a disenchanted ex-member of the party. That last bit is indeed true. Very true.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Farron, by the way, is very, very effective in his use of the media, is approachable as @timfarron on Twitter and comes across as being deeply committed to his party's success. He appears to understand the modern world. To my chagrin I voted for his opponent, Susan Kramer: a candidate unencumbered by the demands of also being an MP, and endorsed by more LibDem people that I respected than Tim. If I then believed she'd do a better job than Tim is doing now she'd have been utterly awesome! (Yes, I'm struggling to seamlessly inject an unjustified Kung Fu Panda reference here.) But, and apologies for the convoluted nature of this paragraph, that's that digression over‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>My disenchantment is pretty much all the local party's fault but, of course, the national party's failure to pull the plug on this unholy alliance with the Conservatives has played a big part. I placed a bet that they'd see sense and provoke a General Election due before the end of 2011. But no, I lost my stake.¬†Despite that I still vote¬†Liberal Democrat.</p>\n\n<p>Now an attack on my political record is a bit rich coming from someone who initially stood as a candidate for the Conservatives and changed parties after her election. It wouldn't have stopped me voting for her though, even as an aspiring MP...¬†People change their views though, it's what reasonable people do, adapting to changing circumstances. Most people though, essentially the great unwashed multitudes of sheep, stick with something all their lives because of some misguided notion that, eventually, 'their' party will generate a utopian ideal specifically tailored to them.</p>\n\n<p>So, back to where I started. I'm proud to have voted Liberal/Liberal Democrat all my life. I voted for (Sir) Cyril Smith and, when Liz Lynne was parachuted into Rochdale from 'the south' despite my obvious 'safe seat' reservations I voted for her too. 'Big' Cyril gave his recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>I've voted for LibDem party candidates at every single opportunity, in my past and here too ... wherever eligible to, I have.¬†So, should I vote Liberal Democrat at the next Council elections? I believe it's the local party leader's turn for re-election.</p>\n\n<p>My gut feeling is no, I won't vote for her, not in a month of Thursdays! Why the hell should I?! Maybe, if she did me a favour and changed parties, it'd make things so much easier.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever, we've got a year for her to change my mind.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Ok, enough of this politics crap, I really don't like its nasty taste. I do though¬†reserve the right to blog/post about local/national/international politics at any point in the future.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This post¬†was inspired by a comment from @neilco on the App.net social network:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I‚Äôm pondering a world where cake is the currency. My dad had this to say about both money and cake: once it‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs gone.</p>\n\n<p>Just imagine a delicious, frosted, edible currency.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My daughters have an uneasy relationship with cake. The¬†lure, allure, whatever you wish to call the experience,¬†of cake is strong and yet its execution in my household¬†is weak. Before you think this is going nowhere, let me explain.</p>\n\n<p>Cakes¬†are bought, put on plates, cut¬†into manageable portions, put on smaller plates and distributed according to the size of the family member to receive them. Number 2 daughter gets the smallest portion, number 1 the next larger, my wife gets the next-up in size and I, being head of the household and biggest, get the biggest. However, the distribution of sizes isn‚Äôt at all as straightforward as¬†this outline implies.</p>\n\n<p>Daughter 2 is still relatively clumsy so the floor gets some, she eats some, she sees something interesting on the TV, all is lost. Daughter 1 is also relatively clumsy, the TV plays a big part in her life too. So, the unconsumed cake, where still edible,¬†usually¬†goes to the head of the household. Me. (My wife is health- and weight-conscious.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, Daughter 2 loves to share.¬†It‚Äôs at the very core of her being. A slight issue is the concept of sharing is somewhat unconventionally applied in her world. I get my slice of cake, it‚Äôs lovely and moist and identical in all-but size to Daughter 2‚Ä≤s. She looks over want WANTS mine. There‚Äôs nothing in-your-face confrontational about the¬†process of her taking over, it‚Äôs seamless. One minute it‚Äôs all mine, the next I‚Äôm feeding her bite-sized portions‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>You‚Äôd think that would be the end of it. Nope, not by a long way.¬†Because I try to be the best dad I can (let‚Äôs not go there) I feel the need to reciprocate the largesse dispensed by my 2 daughters. Ice cream or a trip to ‚ÄòThe Cupboard‚Äô is allowed. It‚Äôs only fair. And when it‚Äôs all over, am I owed a debt of gratitude? Maybe, but I‚Äôm unlikely to ever collect.</p>\n\n<p>‚ÄòThe Cupboard‚Äô, by the way, is where we keep the snacks, not some instrument of discipline similar to a mediaeval¬†iron maiden.¬†No, ‚ÄòThe Cupboard‚Äô is¬†a simple cupboard with shelves, situated at ground level¬†with deliciously-edible contents¬†available to all-comers, incidentally¬†a strategy being re-examined as this very¬†post is written.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually I finish my cake, dreaming of¬†simpler times ‚Äì a single example being once when¬†our 5¬†cats sat in a perfect semi-circle whilst I fed them the meat from an otherwise excellent triple pack of supermarket sandwiches.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, quantitative easing seems a clumsy instrument compared to the arrival of even a single cake at Turner Towers.</p>\n",

Not this mummy here you understand, as I noted at the bottom of the page to the teacher, in a pitiful attempt at humour and face-saving.</li>\n \t<li>30g is a packet of crips (chips if you're the wrong side of the Atlantic Ocean.)</li>\n</ul>So, a name for the monster? She didn't know. So I explained what it must be like being one. \"Just imagine what life must be like as a monster,\" I said. \"Everyone's out to get you simply because you're going round the countryside eating small children and sheep. And, do you know, that's wrong.\"\nShe looked at me for a moment. And then looked again.\n\nI continued \"Imagine all you want is a quiet life, to just go down to the shops and buy some nice food, go home at the end of the day and sit down with a cup of steaming hot chocolate. And you can't because the villagers are out to get you, stab you and set you on fire.\"\nAt this point daughter 1 opened her mouth and said something very appropriate: \"?\"\n\nOk, non-verbal communication is indeed very powerful, but let's move on...\n\n\"So,\" I said \"let's pick a name now. Please.\"\n\n\"Flib-blob-floo-boo,\" or something very close, was her reply. I'm still not sure if as an answer or because I'd melted her brain. But I pushed for an answer - it was past her bedtime.\n\n\"How about Buttercup?\" I asked. \"Just because it's a monster doesn't mean it has to have a horrible name like Raaarg or Snaarlf.\"\n\n\"No.\" came the emphatic response.\n\n\"Snowdrop?\" was met with a giggle. On our way now, I hoped, but I'll spare you the despair I felt when each subsequent pick was rebuffed. Close to giving up or getting her mother to help I gave it my best shot: \"Jim-Bob?\" (her name) \"or Ag-Ack-Ack?\" (her younger sister's name.) Incidentally I'm not in the habit of divulging my family's names publicly. Apart from the cats.\n\nSimply \"No.\"\n\nMy patience wearing thin, inspiration arrived: I asked her to pick a letter of the alphabet to start the name off.\n\n\"F\" she smiled.\n\nImagine my thought bubble: \"Uh-oh.\"\n\n\"i\" arrived quickly, much to my relief.\n\n\"s, h, l, e, g ,s, !\"\n\nDone, at last!\n\nAnd here she is:\n\n<a href=\"/images/fishlegs.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/194309/2024/968628470f.jpg\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1444\" width=\"578\" height=\"485\"></a>\n\nI have what's been called a well-developed sense of humour. Ok, I'm putting a positive spin on it. Being frank, a lot of people think I'm a bit weird. And some think I'm a lot weird. And, do you know, I have no problem with that.\n\nI <em>do</em> have a problem with the dangly bulbous-ended thing between Fishlegs' legs. I dare not ask, especially as I made the assumption a girl would pick a <em>female</em> monster.\n\n...\n\n\"A tail?\" you say.\n\nNaah, she's seen my willy.\n",
